A few days later, that interview was taken down by the publisher. It is still available in the internet archive.\nThe interview included the following:\n\"Quite a few developers said they were nervous about building with the OpenAI APIs when OpenAI might end up releasing products that are competitive to them. Sam said that OpenAI would not release more products beyond ChatGPT. He said there was a history of great platform companies having a killer app and that ChatGPT would allow them to make the APIs better by being customers of their own product. The vision for ChatGPT is to be a super smart assistant for work but there will be a lot of other GPT use-cases that OpenAI won\u2019t touch.\"",

      "resolution": 0.0,
      "background": "Hurricane season in Virginia runs from June 1 to November 30. Virginia uses a system known as \"Know Your Zone\" featuring four zones for at-risk areas which can be used for evacuation orders:\n\u201cKnow Your Zone\u201d serves roughly 1.25 million residents who live in Coastal Virginia, the region of the state most vulnerable to hurricanes and other tropical storms. Twenty-three localities participate in the tiered evacuation zones. Zones were developed in close coordination with local emergency managers throughout Hampton Roads, the Northern Neck, the Middle Peninsula and the Eastern Shore based on the most up-to-date engineering data for the region.\nZones are designated A through D. Zones provide residents with clarity on whether they should evacuate in an emergency or shelter at home, based on their physical street address and the nature of the emergency event. When a serious storm is expected to threaten or impact Virginia\u2019s coastal regions, state and local emergency agencies will work with local news media outlets, as well as social media channels, that will then broadcast and publish evacuation directives to the public.\n. . .\nWhen a storm is approaching, emergency managers will determine which zones are most at risk considering the intensity, path, speed, tides and other meteorological factors. Emergency managers at the state and local level will work with local media and use social media and other tools to notify residents of impacted zones what they should do to stay safe.\nDepending on the emergency, being safe might mean staying at home, a short trip to higher ground, or traveling to a different region of the state.\nThe Governor, Virginia Emergency Management Officials, and Local Governments may order a mandatory evacuation.",

      "resolution": 0.0,
      "background": "According to the bill, the act is intended \"to prevent States and local jurisdictions from interfering with the production and distribution of agricultural products in interstate commerce, and for other purposes.\"\nThe \u201cEnding Agricultural Trade Suppression Act\u201d (EATS) bill was introduced in the US Senate on June 15, 2023 by Senators Roger Marshall (R-KS), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Eric Schmitt (R-MO).\nCritics and proponents alike say that the legislation is a response to the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 recent decision to uphold Proposition 12, a law that prohibits \"the sale of eggs, pork, and/or veal from caged animals raised anywhere in the world\".\nCritics of the EATS Act argue that the bill would worsen animal welfare across the country:\nThe EATS Act, if passed, would increase suffering for the vast majority of land animals raised for food in the United States and reverse decades of progress for hens, pigs, and calves. It would invalidate crucial anti-confinement laws in numerous states throughout the country and could prevent other states from adopting similar policies in the future.\nProponents say that the act would preserve interstate agricultural trade and prevent undue interference by state and local governments:\nThe legislation prohibits state and local governments from interfering with agricultural production nationwide, while preserving their ability to regulate farming and ranching within their jurisdictions. [...] California's Proposition 12 imposes onerous standards on pork products sold in the state, regardless of where the pigs are raised. The policy would add significant costs to pork producers and consumers across the nation. Iowa was among 20 states to file an amicus brief opposing the law in 2021.",

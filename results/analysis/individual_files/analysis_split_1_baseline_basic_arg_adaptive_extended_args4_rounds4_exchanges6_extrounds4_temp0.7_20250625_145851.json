Such a product would offer conventional retail investors straightforward exposure to this emergent digital asset by trading on public stock exchanges like existing ETFs.\nAn SEC-approved Ethereum ETF would constitute a watershed moment for increased mainstream and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. By providing a regulated on-ramp for retail investors to gain price exposure to Ethereum, an ETF could rapidly multiply investment flows.

Hamas's rise to power in Gaza was marked by its victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, a result that surprised many and led to tensions with political rival Fatah, culminating in the 2007 clashes.

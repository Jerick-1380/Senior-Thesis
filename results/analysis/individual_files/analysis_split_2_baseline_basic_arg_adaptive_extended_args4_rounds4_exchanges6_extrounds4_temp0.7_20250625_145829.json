      "background": "Donald Trump is facing four indictments (in New York, Florida, Washington DC, and Georgia) as well as a civil case in New York.\nIn the New York civil case, Trump was fined twice, first for $5,000 on October 20 and then again for $10,000 on October 25, for violating a gag order against commenting publicly about Judge Arthur Engoron's staff.\nTrump was also subject to a gag order imposed in the DC case by Judge Tanya Chutkan on October 16th against commenting about court staff, prosecutors, or witnesses. That gag order was lifted on October 20th after Trump appealed, but was reinstated on October 29th.\nFollowing the reinstatement, Ty Cobb, former White House lawyer during Trump's presidency, said:\nWell, the New York judge fined him $10,000. That\u2019s in a civil case. That\u2019s not as consequential as Judge Chutkan\u2019s case. . . I think she\u2019ll come in with a much heavier penalty, and ultimately, I think he\u2019ll spend a night or a weekend in jail.",

      "question": "Will Volodymyr Zelenskyy visit Israel before 2024?",
      "resolution": 0.0,
      "background": "From the onset of the Gaza-Israel conflict, many pro-Israeli nations have shown their support for Israel via high profile visits including, US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nUkraine is another nation which is seen as pro-Israeli, however, in past and present times, the relationship between both nations has appeared tentative. Israel still maintains friendly relations with Russia, and Israel has yet to outright condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Israel has also, until recently, refused to send military aid to Ukraine which is in stark contrast to many of Israel's western allies.\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy initially indicated his intention to visit Israel in a show of support, however this was initially shot-down by Netanyahu, stating that the \"time is not right\".\nThis decision was short-lived, as it was recently reported that Zelenskyy's trip to Israel was in advanced stages of planning. Said reporting, however, was leaked (presumably by members of Netenyahu's government), and the trip was promptly cancelled:\nAccording to the diplomat, the Ukrainian president \"wanted the trip to be public when he stepped on Israeli soil.\" \"He's very disappointed,\" he added.",

      "resolution": 1.0,
      "background": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) closely monitors respiratory illnesses, particularly when these illnesses increase in prevalence during the winter. One monitoring and data sharing tool the CDC uses is RESP-NET, which it describes as follows:\nThe Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) comprises three networks that conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza among children and adults. While RESP-NET does not collect data on all hospitalizations caused by respiratory illnesses, it can describe hospitalizations caused by three viruses that account for a large proportion of these hospitalizations. Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties or county equivalents in 12 states for RSV surveillance, 13 states for COVID-19 surveillance, and 14 states for influenza surveillance. The surveillance platforms for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza (known as COVID-NET, RSV-NET, and FluSurv-NET, respectively) cover more than 30 million people and include an estimated 8-10% of the U.S. population.\nThe underlying source data for the RESP-NET dashboard can be found at this link.\nIn its Respiratory Disease Season Outlook for 2023-24, the CDC describes the 2022-23 peak as a \"tripledemic\" due to high incidence of COVID, flu, and RSV at the same time. The RESP-NET figures for the 2022-23 season show a large combined peak hospitalization rate of 22.2 per 100,000 for the week ending December 3, 2022, the sum of the following rates for the three respiratory illnesses:\nCOVID-19: 9.3\nFlu: 8.7\nRSV: 4.2",

Penn President Liz Magill stepped down after receiving backlash for her responses during the hearing.\nClaudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth remain presidents of their respective universities, and on December 12th the Harvard board unanimously expressed their support for Gay. However, Gay has also faced accusations of plagiarism during the increased scrutiny, and on December 13th the US House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning antisemitism that included a call for Gay and Kornbluth to step down. According to Axios:\nThe resolution passed 303-126, with 84 Democrats voting in favor of it and 125 voting against it. All Republicans except Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) voted for it. . . The measure was voted on under a process known as suspension of the rules, meaning it needed two-thirds, or roughly 290 votes, to pass.",

      "question": "Will NASA re-establish communications with Voyager 1 before 1 Jan 2024?",
      "resolution": 0.0,
      "background": "The Voyager probes are the human-made machines that have gone both the fastest and the furthest away from Earth. They were launched in the late '70s,\nInitially designed to last five years, the Voyager probes are the two longest-operating spacecraft in history. Their exceptionally long lifespans mean that both spacecraft have provided additional insights about our solar system and beyond after achieving their preliminary goals of flying by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune decades ago.\nHowever, their continued operation relies on creative ways to shut down instruments to conserve power, and it's not always smooth sailing:\nAlong the way, both spacecraft have encountered unexpected issues and dropouts, including a seven-month period in 2020 when Voyager 2 couldn\u2019t communicate with Earth. In August, the mission team used a long-shot \u201cshout\u201d technique to restore communications with Voyager 2 after a command inadvertently oriented the spacecraft\u2019s antenna in the wrong direction.\nUnfortunately, now\nVoyager 1\u2019s flight data system now appears to be stuck on auto-repeat. The mission team first noticed the issue November 14, when the flight data system\u2019s telecommunications unit began sending back a repeating pattern of ones and zeroes, like it was trapped in a loop.\nA fix is unlikely to to implemented before the new year.\nIt could take several weeks for engineers to develop a new plan to remedy the issue. Finding solutions to challenges the probes encounter often entails consulting original, decades-old documents written by engineers who didn\u2019t anticipate the issues that are arising today. As a result, it takes time for the team to understand how a new command will affect the spacecraft\u2019s operations in order to avoid unintended consequences.\nThis question answers how unlikely, exactly?",

[1] talks of how the material could in theory allow for sc, if only there was something to give it a 'kick', but are unsure on how one would achieve that. [2] talks of how the addition of oxygen via annealing the sample in an oxygen rich environment at the final stages of synthesis, could enable the sc capability of the material. it effectively that the addition of the oxygen gives the material an added 'kick'. \"we may conclude that the hybridization between the cu d-states of the cu doped with the p state of the fully occupied 1/4 occupied o1 atoms may be the key for the realization of the room temperature superconductivity\" call it hopium/copium, but the original korean papers are already so immensely vague and storied in their publication, that really anything could have/have not happened, for them to have gotten the results they did. so a method that could so easily happen by accident (exposing the material to air during synthesis) may well have happened to them, and is what gave them the results they published. it could be interesting if the team from [1] re-did their analysis on the composition proposed by [2], and see if they get the 'kick' they theorise.

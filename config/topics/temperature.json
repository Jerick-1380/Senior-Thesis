The summer of 2023 was Earth's hottest since global records began in 1880 , according to scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) in New York. The average global land and ocean surface temperature in August was 2.25 degrees F (1.25 degrees C) above the 20th-century average of 60.1 degrees F (15.6 degrees C), ranking as  the warmest August in the 174-year global climate record .

After a warm summer the winter is also taking a long time to came. Dr. Leon Hermanson, an expert scientist at the Met Office, publish a study that conclude that global mean temperatures are expected to continue rising, to levels completely different than what is used to. Studies from the World Meteorological Organization reveal that there is a 66% chance that the annual average near-surface global temperature will exceed 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year between 2023 and 2027. Additionally, there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years, as well as the entire five-year period, will break the record for the warmest year on record.

This increase is indicative of a long-term warming trend, and this trend is expected to continue. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are also a major contributor to this warming. About 1.1 billion tons of carbon, equivalent to about 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide, are emitted into the atmosphere each year. This amount exceeds what nature can absorb, and as a result, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing every year. Taken together, these data and trends suggest that it is very likely that the global average temperature in 2024 will exceed that of 2023.

Several reasons support that: First and foremost, there has been a steady and apparent pattern of temperature increase in recent last years. Despite the implementation of environmental policies, this tendency is mostly linked to the continued rise in global pollution levels. As the planet's temperature rises, it has a direct impact on the polar ice caps and glaciers, forcing them to melt at a faster rate. This, in turn, contributes to sea-level rise. Melting icebergs not only show global warming but also serve as a vivid indicator of the planet's rising temperature."

The likelihood of a strong El Ni\u00f1o at year-end is about 40%, with experts predicting it will continue into spring (75-85% chance).

The whole point is that modeling things in the real world with math tools is not an isomorphism with the things in the real world being mathematical definitions themselves! I hope that clears it up. To make talking about a number of oranges in this scenario mathematically rigorous, you'd need to prove that the number of oranges is some defined number for everyone.

I think one can see evidence of mispricings all over the place currently, where even relatively short-term markets are 15% or more away from a reasonable price just because of the opportunity cost of not putting that mana into the superconductor market (and I don't correct them, because same). I suspect many NOs feel similarly, though most are probably a little more sensible and not going quite as all-in as I am (I am very confident so am happy with the risk, but that's obviously a matter of opinion). The NOs are outnumbered here but they are richer and will get much larger loans.

I am very skeptical, but it needs to be checked out. The synthesis does not look difficult. These are well known phosphate oxide materials. At first glance the levitation looks impressive. However, if you look carefully you see that sample 2 (which was levitated) has a large diamagnetic magnetization in the normal state. The change into the so-called SC state is small. So, it could be levitated just because it's a diamagnetic material in the normal state. The transitions that they show as a function of current and I seem unusually sharp. The shift in critical current with the field is also larger than I would have expected. Also, it is not clear where the carriers come from in this system. Without copper it's an insulator. The Cu2+ substitution for Pb2+ should not change the carrier count. The claim is that the internal pressure drives an insulator to metal transition.

If someone claims something is a superconductor - usually the claim is wrong, because they were measuring noise. But if they managed to pick out the diamond in the pile of dirt - that's hard! That means they aren't measuring noise, and lends credence to the idea their measurement might be entirely correct, and your reproduction might have flaws (which is expected, getting materials right is hard).

Many data points weren't processed carefully. The data from the main channel for returning lines doesn't overlap, and even Figure S2 is hand-drawn without any beautification. It's probably just the first paper to stake a claim, with later revisions or new articles to follow. This explanation is essentially the same as our initial one: part paramagnetic, part diamagnetic, resulting in some sticking and some bouncing off, an intuitive explanation. However, labeling it as weak ferromagnetism is a bit forced. There's no ferromagnet with such a small magnetization, not even saturating at a 3T magnetic field. The zero-field residual magnetism appears more like a measurement error; it's too negligible. If it must be explained as ferromagnetic, at most, it might have formed some small magnetic domains, leading to the low magnetization. Moreover, the arrangement of lead, phosphorus, copper, and oxygen, how could it exhibit ferromagnetism? It doesn't align with physical intuition. Ferromagnetic and diamagnetic shouldn't coexist in the same sample unless it's a ferromagnetic superconductor. And under 10Oe, diamagnetic signals appear first? This ferromagnet is too weak, it can't even suppress diamagnetism.

Look what happens when it's standing straight up and gets nudged. It springs back to fully upright, but never stays in an intermediate position. A superconductor could pin in any orientation, but this sample always aligns with the magnetic field. Flipping the polarization, if you do it fast enough, should cause some torque on a soft ferromagnet because its magnetic domains wouldn't reorient instantly. That should at least make it shiver, if not flip. But I can't see anything in the video about whether/when they flipped the field or how fast.

      "text": "A fascinating read from a team in Manchester [1] who attempted to replicate the original LK-99 findings. They found that the synthesis process produces \"molten reactants\" during the 925c process, which in their first attempt, lead to \"severe cracking or even the total breakdown\" of the quartz ampoules. Further, the synthesised materials showed \"lead matrix with islands of aggregated copper\". Even after they finally managed to produce something that matched the XRD of LK-99, they still found it to still be full of copper aggregates. I personally believe this is due to Cu3P's melting point being 900c, and the sintering being conducted at 925c.  Finally, they did have strong para/ferromagnetic response in their sample, showing behaviours previously seen in LK-99 'levitation'. They picked out these parts of the product and used EDX to identify that they had somehow contaminated the reactants with iron, despite their efforts. I suspect this was due to them grinding the reagents in an 'agate mortar', which whilst typically composed of 99.9% SiO2, is known to have trace contaminants of iron oxide. They then went on to the typical test gamut of \"Yup, it matches the XRD of the original paper\", \"Yup, it doesn't float\", \"Yup, it doesn't superconduct\". I personally conclude from this that, once again, the process of synthesising LK-99 is the prime culprit for teams not being able to reproduce the original paper's findings, and that further first-party research and development into better synthesis processes are required. Merely attempting to peer-review the original papers is not the way to go.

And indeed it looks like it isn't true - the partial hover that people were attributing to diamagnetism turned out to be ferromagnetism. However, the  same preprint  that explained the partial hover in terms of ferromagnetism actually also measured one of its phases to be very diamagnetic. Not as diamagnetic as pyrolytic graphite, and not nearly diamagnetic enough to suspect superconductivity, but respectably the second-most diamagnetic non-superconducting material we know of, second only to pyrolytic graphite. That certainly came as a surprise to me. We'll see if that measurement of its diamagnetic susceptibility pans out, I believe it's a pretty uncertain measurement. But yeah, for now it seems like it is quite diamagnetic."

Biden completing his term).   Other people specialize in identifying longshots, but I think there is a general longshot bias in most markets (including sports -- also see the RFK Jr Dem nomination odds for a great example) and perhaps even in casinos/lotteries (craps has some of the best odds, but doesn't pay well - so people play the slot machines and other games with worse odds). And the weirder the event is (see anything to do with aliens), and more likely to attract people who aren't as rational / expected value oriented and as experienced as betting as I, the more likely I'm automatically thinking No.  But I'm relatively risk adverse - so before putting money on things I do some research. BTW I think very few people use it, but once you have a market price and an expected value - you can use Kelly Criterion to determine how much you should bet. That said, I think it over-estimates the amount - and I'm not sure how to handle uncertainty?   For instance, my 17% prediction is very uncertain - otherwise I'd be doubling down (both on Manifold and with real money)."

The correct solution here is to use whatever interpretation aligns with your priors, but given that the pessimistic update is smaller it offsets the fact that there's more money backing it up, and hence it does indeed cancel out with the update of the optimistic interpretation.  In summary, we need not just evidence that can produce a big update, but also that can be unanimously interpreted as being optimistic or pessimistic regardless of your priors. And this wasn't that."

Gpt-4 translation of the Facebook post  \"On my morning commute, I revisited basic physics. Although I'm a theoretical physicist and don't really feel it directly, experimental physicists, who have to experiment through electrical circuits, tend to prioritize this when new equipment comes in. While I was admiring the shiny new equipment nearby, a simple \"Good job!\" would have sufficed, but... The attached blog well explains the concept of impedance. To explain this a bit more in the style of Kim Young-lo's Vocabulary 33000, \"impedance\" consists of the Latin prefix \"im-\" which has the sense of negation, and \"ped\" from Latin which means to walk, along with the noun suffix \"-ance\" that denotes characteristics or shape. For more details, please refer to a dictionary that explains word origins. Recently, at the Korean Energy Institute, while showcasing their latest TEM equipment, what caught people's attention was a clear crystal structure image. Another presented detail was that the impedance of the measured LK-99 thin film sample was 0. This sample didn't particularly need alternating current, and when direct current was applied, it means the resistance is 0 - which implies superconductivity! However, why didn't they announce it as a superconductor? There's a reason. That YouTuber asked ChatGPT and edited a great explanation stating that measuring 0 resistance doesn't prove superconductivity. I'll try to explain it my way: No matter what measurement device we use, there are always inherent noises in the universe that make it difficult to confirm a resistance of 0. We can even observe cosmic background radiation. We only observe a signal jittering within a very small resistance range, and we apply the epsilon-delta logic of calculus to consider it as 0 resistance within the arbitrary limit we set, which can be seen as the limit of the experimental equipment. To confirm it as superconductivity, we need to measure the Meissner effect that follows superconductivity, which involves measuring the sample's magnetic susceptibility. Floating a superconductor over a magnet is more of a show for the general public. Even as a scientist who knows the reason, it's fascinating when it floats. The precise measuring device for magnetic susceptibility is the SQUID, which, in simple terms, is a device that measures minute magnetic fields using a superconductor. This equipment is also expensive. It's possible that the Energy Institute either doesn't have this equipment or, if they do, it's not currently in service. We can just enjoy it as it is.\" Here is the Facebook link from the Twitter post \" https://www.facebook.com/100011241031645/posts/pfbid02RndBvoiWFausXGvfauLk6Z4DXKkZbwRFUN9NarCjvfKHDJPfG4HaFoNF8uHCmn5Vl/?app=fb [LINK PREVIEW] In-Gee Kim - \uc544\uce68 \ucd9c\uadfc\uae38\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uacf5\ubd80\ud574 \ubcf8\ub2e4. \ub098\ub294 \uc774\ub860\ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc790\ub77c \ub531\ud788 \uccb4\uac10\ub418\uc9c0...

I was expecting a elongated crystal, and that's exactly what I got. 2. Both room temperature superconductor and a new ferromagnetic material are correct. The type of crystal is determined by where copper is located in the positions of lead in the crystal. These two crystals are mixed in a Boltzmann distribution. 3. I no longer need any further experimental verification. The original authors have discovered something even more remarkable than initially thought. Congratulations to them."

Right now there is a few hundred thousand mana of open trading interest in the order book, so that's the most you can sell at once, and the more you sell the worse the price you get is. This part is incorrect. A big shareholder does not cash out by selling all at once. They do it by either holding until resolution, or selling gradually over time.

Yes, it still may be in the unsearched area of A. That's true, it may be. But you were searching randomly. So the initial condition still holds, that the key is randomly distributed in the unsearched space. And now since most of that space is in B, it's highly likely it's there. When LK-99 was announced it had a certain possibility of being true. But we have eliminated so much of that space. Now, it's not just true, it's also hard to replicate, AND not possible to send samples, AND team won't talk AND team has failed to convince anyone they personally AND they failed to convince any journal etc So yes there is still a way for it to be real, but what we see is also nearly all compatible with it not being real. That's why I have shifted more and more to the NO side, because the YES story is shrinking. Gradually as reports get further delayed and fail to come out, the space will shrink more and you'll have to come up with even more convoluted reasons. And your reasons may be plausible. There is always some story you can construct. I'm not attacking your story. The very fact that a story can always be created that explains anything means that I can never win by defeating stories. (Because you can always add another layer of conspiracy or mistake). That's why I proceed statistically. YES  is  possible, just getting less and less likely while NO's potential stays about the same.  So I'm asking YES people - do you notice yourself revising stories as it goes? You do realize that using that technique you can prove anything, right? No matter what data comes out you will always be able to construct a scenario where it's still true. Just being able to do that doesn't make you actually likely to be correct in reality. At some point please consider the relative likelihood of it being a mistaken report.

If the superconductivity appears in the relevant temperature range, it is a significant shift. From the curve of the preliminary results of the experiment, it is currently in this temperature range is no antimagnetism appears. The Y-axis of the experimental data represents the magnetization strength, if it has antimagnetism, at least the magnetic moment should be negative in the numerical value, but the experimental results can be seen, its starting value is in 0, all the values are in the interval above 0. So this time the antimagnetism is not shown by this set of data. So no diamagnetic behavior was observed in their sample. The article notes that this test was conducted by the Key Laboratory for High Temperature Superconductivity at Shanghai University. Source:  https://www.kankanews.com/detail/7Y2zD0xP5Qo"

First of all from what we have seen so far and the original video it would be impossible to explain that this material can rise so high due to diamagnetism. The mechanism of diamagnetism is very wel known and is caused due to the magnetic field affecting the motion of orbiting electrons. Diamagnetism is present in ALL materials, so unless this material somehow magically can summon electrons out of satans asshole it can not explain such a huge diamagnetic effect compared to any other known element. This leads us to conclude that the diamagnetic effect we see is probably caused by a current, and since it stays up it must be a super current ergo a super conductor."

So the videos we've seen are consistent with type I superconductivity (as well as with non-superconducting diamagnetism). Whereas a stable hover would be consistent with type II and inconsistent with type I. Our priors are very low for LK-99 being type I though because unlike type II, we actually have a working theory for them that rules out high temperature type I superconductors. Some are also claiming it is a brand new type, in which case who knows what magnetic properties it might have, but my priors would be low for that too."

      "text": "my background is cold atoms, so my understanding of how the flux pinning stuff actually works comes from a conversation with GPT-4 last week where I asked it to explain it all to me in ways that relate to vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates, which I do know a bit more about. BECs are superfluids and so are the cooper pairs in superconductors, and so there's a lot of overlap there - but I think a lot of the details about what to actually expect and what it looks like in practice you can only get from experience that I don't have much of. Other than youtube videos and playing with pieces of YBCO a few times. Anyway, my understanding (thanks GPT-4) is that exactly how far you can push the sample and have it return to its original location or orientation is going to be highly material-dependent and purity-dependent. The flux pinning is from supercurrent vortices (through which magnetic flux can pass) being pinned in place at the location of defects in the material. When you move the sample, the vortices distort but stay stuck to the same defects, and the effect of this on the supercurrent is to produce a magnetic field that results in a restoring force to the original position and orientation, in which the vortices will be a nice low-energy lattice again. But if you move it far enough, you can get these vortices to jump to different defects, and then the material will be locked to some new position and orientation. So it seems like how far you can move it and have it spring back is going to depend on the density of the defects and how strongly the vortices are pinned to them, which are presumably going to be highly material-specific properties."

The text still references x =1 but that does not allow for the intended number of Cu for the Cu-O chain. The image still has some mistakes so this could be just a bad correction. Relevant because the replications so far have been for x = 1 and not for other values of x (although they have patented all possible values of x).  Why is this relevant: Option 1 (blue pill): The Koreans have doubts relative to the exact formula of what they made or that they are prone to simple chemical mistakes (big points in favor of NO). Option 2 (red pill): They know what they made but the first pre-print and the April paper where wrong and all replications where trying to make the wrong material (points in favor of YES).

Diamagnets can be levitated by certain configurations of magnets. But  @chrisjbillington  i s correct that they can\u2019t levitate above a single dipole magnet. This is because diamagnets are attracted towards regions of low magnetic field and for a dipole magnetic the magnetic field falls both as you move away from the magnet and, importantly, as you move alway from the line going though the center of the magnet. So a diamagnet levitating above a dipole magnet will tend to get pushed off of the magnet to the side.  Technically we don\u2019t know how the magnets in the video are magnetized, so it's possible they are magnetized in a way that would allow diamagnetic levitation but IMO this in unlikely."

Overly precise criteria that are adhered to despite turning out to be contrary to the spirit of the market are a real problem that ruin a lot of the point of markets. There needs to be some flexibility. Basically i think that if it seems like in hindsight we would have written the resolution criteria to include whatever this thing turns out to be, then it should resolve YES (and vice versa). This often requires some judgement which can be fraught if the creator has a large stake, but IMHO it's better than the precise criteria causing a resolution essentially uncorrelated with what people thought they were betting on because the criteria were not written with specific corner cases in mind. We should make criteria as precise as we can, but I think we should not adhere to them too strongly if it is clear reality has drifted from the assumptions under which they were written. Unless the specifics are truly what you want to make a market about. For me they're not - I want a market about whether this thing is a superconductor, even if it shifts the definition of what that means."

Let me give a less contentious example: If I flip a coin, and am thinking about it while it's in the air, there's actually just a fact of the matter about whether it will come down heads or tails. If I could pause time and take detailed enough measurements, a physics simulation would be able to tell me whether it will land heads or tails. The only sense in which there's randomness when the coin is in the air is due to my uncertainty. For a more extreme example, imagine you flip a coin and look at the result, but hide it from me. The Bayesian view is that it's still meaningful for me to say \"50% chance it came up heads\", even though from your perspective it's either 0% or 100%."

Several assertions have already been made about room temperature superconductivity but were never verified or reproduced across the labs. The cuprates were the earliest high transition temperature superconductors, and it seems that copper has done the magic once again. Last week, a Korean group synthesized a Lead Apatite-based compound LK-99, showing a Tc of above 400\u2218K. The signatures of superconductivity in the compound are very promising, in terms of resistivity (R = 0) and diamagnetism at Tc. Although, the heat capacity (Cp) did not show the obvious transition at Tc. Inspired by the interesting claims of above room temperature superconductivity in LK-99, in this article, we report the synthesis of polycrystalline samples of LK-99, by following the same heat treatment as reported in [1,2] by the two-step precursor method. The phase is confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, performed after each heat treatment. The room temperature diamagnetism is not evidenced by the levitation of a permanent magnet over the sample or vice versa. Further measurements for the confirmation of bulk superconductivity on variously synthesized samples are underway.  Our results on the present LK-99 sample, being synthesized at 925\u2218C, as of now do not approve the appearance of bulk superconductivity at room temperature. Further studies with different heat treatments are though, yet underway .\" Emphasis mine. Just appeared on the arXiv"

The factoid going around saying \"if it's a diamagnet it's an impossibly strong one, the only things this diamagnetic are superconductors\" appears to be false. I am not 100% sure but I keep asking for this claim to be backed up, nobody has done so, the source appears to be Iris on Twitter who I do not consider to be a reliable source on these things, and some of the most expert people on the matter consider it obvious enough to make fun of (see tweet below - this one regarding an unrelated claim of superconductivity). A judgement call to be sure, but 90% Type II, 9% brand new type, 1% type I. And I think I'm probably rating Type II too low here. Type I are well understood, theory is thought to be correct and doesn't permit room temperature type I superconductors. So if we find one it means the theory was wrong. Whereas there is nothing in our current understanding precluding a room-temperature type II superconductor, no physics will need to be rewritten if we find one. And low priors for a brand new type in general just because it's been a long time since superconductivity was discovered and we only know of two types. But it could always happen. Orders of magnitude? Multiple? Yes, then I think  I'd rate it pretty highly, maybe 70% or more. For the sole reason that I read Michael Fuhrer say that very strong diamagnetism is a strong indicator of superconductivity, and I trust him. (the fact that he remains unimpressed by all this tells me that what we're seeing is not anywhere near strong enough diamagnetism for this to apply). But if it actually became apparent that it was extremely diamagnetic, I'd go back and make sure I'd understood correctly what Michael Fuhrer had written - or whether it had changed his view. This is going to be a much better approach than trying to work it out myself. If you're wondering why I trust this specific physicist, it's because he has a good track record arguing rationally on controversial topics during COVID. He and I both role-played epidemiologists on Twitter during the pandemic, and I saw him take both contrarian and mainstream views depending on the topic, in what looked like a principled way. So he is both a top subject matter expert and has the kinds of attitude towards the truth that I expect in people with forecasting/prediction expertise, which is an excellent combination for something like this."

I'll estimate a 1% prior probability this material is actually a room temperature superconductor before seeing any evidence. Main evidence increasing probability: - Research team has expertise in superconductors and published papers showing a potential mechanism.  - Videos show apparent diamagnetic levitation. - Multiple patents filed related to the material. - Lab announced material samples will be released for verification. Main evidence decreasing probability: - Extremely extraordinary claim that would overturn much of physics if true. - No independent verification or peer review yet after 3 years.  - No direct observation of zero resistance or Meissner effect reported. - No jump in specific heat shown across transition temperature. - Co-authors said papers were incomplete and released without permission. - DFT simulations suggest material unlikely to be superconducting without extra doping. Taking all the evidence into account, I estimate a 12% probability that LK-99 is a room temperature superconductor based on the currently available information. This represents only a modest increase from the 1% prior probability, as the evidence is still very preliminary and lacks critical verification. As more rigorous experimental results are published, the probability estimate could change substantially in either direction. Will now try again but in more single prompts."

      "text": "A magnetic dipole is a magnet, and will be attracted or repelled from another magnet depending on the orientation (opposite poles attract, like repel). A diamagnet is repelled from a magnet regardless of orientation. Flux pinning is where a material is stuck at a specific location and orientation relative to the magnetic field it's in. A material that is flux-pinned will move away from a magnet if the magnet is moved toward it. However it will also move  toward  the magnet if the magnet is pulled  away  from it. It is locked at a specific position in the magnetic field of the magnet and moves with it. Flux pinning is only seen in superconductors. Diamagnetism and ferromagnetism (the property you need to make a magnetic dipole out of something) do not require superconductivity. So flux pinning is the smoking gun, otherwise these videos are all consistent with phenomena that don't require superconductivity. Flux pinning would not be hard to demonstrate, and you can bet superconductor researchers would want to demonstrate it if their samples exhibited it. They haven't done so. If I see a single video showing such a thing, I will be betting YES to the extent I think the video is not faked. Not all superconductors exhibit flux pinning, but of the known types of superconductor, LK-99 is much more likely to be the kind that does - the other is well understood and not thought to be possible at high temperatures. It could also be a brand new type - but I think that unlikely as well. So I am looking for flux pinning, I haven't seen it yet except in one video I think is fake. I guarantee you if a credible video of flux pinning comes out, physicists will immediately be in consensus that that material is a superconductor. Until then, or until someone actually reproduces it having zero resistance, it might be a superconductor, but there isn't really any good evidence for it yet."

So 10%, because scientific breakthroughs are rare and this is the kind of thing that gets hyped on the internet without being real (but enough people believed it could be real that it was significantly > 1%) - then I upgraded to 15% and then 17% as I was influenced by the hype and market price and it seemed like there as a chance someone might replicate it or come close with all the work going into it.

The history of these things replicating is extremely poor such that those in the know treat papers like this almost as they would UFO sightings, despite the fact that RTAPSC are totally consistent with known physics and reasonably more likely to found this century than aliens. And despite the appearance of promising data in early papers. That's how bad the history is. In trusting that I should treat these papers that way as well, my priors around whether this is reflexive rejection from stodgy old scientists stuck in their ways is strongly against. These are people some of whom I know and respect, and who I see take contrarian positions when it makes sense. The field does not appear to be a groupthink-dominated conform-fest, it is not ideological. They would all love nothing more than for a RTAPSC to be the real deal. Whereas the circles on twitter coming up with increasingly elaborate ways of excusing failures to replicate as being due to increasingly speculative phenomena that would require the discovery to be multiple breakthroughs at once rather than just the one (keeping in mind that we have no reason to expect the discovery of RTAPSC to require additional fundamental breakthroughs) - look to me to be engaging in a cargo cult version of science, even those who have PhDs. It looks like hype feeding hype with caution thrown to the wind. I can't take them seriously, as much as I would love it for outsiders to have the right idea when insiders didn't. (This is a romantic idea to most insiders too! Everybody loves it when this happens! Sean Carroll recently did a podcast all about how he came into physics with this idea that he'd be a contrarian, only to learn physics was not as stodgy and stuck in its ways as he thought). None of the evidence from the authors is compelling. The strong partial levitation is not evidence of much, other materials can do that - you've seen the videos - and has not been replicated and could even be fraudulent. The weaker magnetic effects that have been shown in replications haven't even been demonstrated to be repulsive. Basically nothing of interest has replicated yet and so we're still at those priors as I see it. And those priors for me are informed by the impression that the experts are actual experts deserving of that title and whose views should be deferred to (gasp!). They are not just reflexively opposing new ideas, fearful of being replaced by upstarts. I think I believe this for good reason, having been around some of these people and knowing how they think, and I think when the evidence changes such that there's more than a tiny chance of LK-99 panning out, we'll hear it from those experts just as quickly as from anyone else."

Another example: We use calculus for physics all the time, despite the fact that we can only take derivatives of continuous functions, and all our measurements are necessarily discrete time series."

He thinks that it being a not-widely-known exception to diamagnetic levitation in a dipole field being impossible - unknown to most and not demonstrated once by youtube magnetic levitation nerds who would definitely have done it with graphite if it were possible - is more likely than the video being a simple fake. Come on! This is atrocious reasoning. He thinks he's found such an exception buried deep in the literature that people have overlooked, and thinks that's more likely than that he (or more likely whoever linked him to that paper*) simply misunderstood it. Ridiculous hubris! As far as I can tell there's no such exception - and that's not even what the paper is about. The paper is about using an arrangement of diamagnets and permanent magnets to stabilise levitation of a permanent magnet. The stuff about diamagnetic levitation being possible is just commentary about diamagnets not being subject to Earnshaw's theorem like permanent magnets are, such that diamagnets can levitate in certain fields (not dipole fields) but we already knew that. I cant say for sure I've understood this paper fully - reading papers is hard! - but I can guarantee Andrew hasn't either. (* the only google results for \"Brauenbecker extension\" are Andrew's tweet, /sci/ and a Korean discussion board, all discussing LK-99. So I would guess he got it from /sci/. Brauenbecker did write a paper about diagmagnetic levitation, and I haven't tried too hard to find an  English translation but from the context in which the paper Andrew links to cites it, it's about diamagnetic levitation being possible at all - which we already know - not about it being possible in dipole fields.)"

Paramagnetism is a spring-like change, where the induced dipole is proprtional to the applied field (think Hooke's law), and it comes from rotation of electron pairs in individual atoms. Ferromagnetism is nonlinear and hysteretic, because it comes from gradual alignment of magnetic domain orientations within each metal grain (which are initially determined by the grain geometry). Even with low coercivity the direction of polarization for a ferromagnet will change much slower than a paramagnet."

Several companies which had been claimed to be partners by the QERC has stated that their name has been \"used without authorization\". Quantum Energy Research Center Inc. advertises a superconductor material they claim to have developed, called LK-99, on their website. Based on multiple patents and papers, they claim that they've \"developed the world's first room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor\". They've also written down that they are partners with multiple different big companies and universities. These are: Samsung SDI, SKC solmics, LG InnoTech, Posco, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Sumitomo, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), Korean Chemical Society, Korea University, Hanyang University, Inje University. But the companies named on Partners list have responded that this is \"not factual\". LG InnoTech has said \"We are completely unaware of this company\", saying \"We have requested QERC to take down our trademark from their website and demanded an explanation surrounding the unauthorized usage\". Samsung Electro-Mechanics and Samsung SDI have both said \"We have never even received an official partnership offer\". These companies all have not engaged in joint research in their corporate research labs. The KRICT has stated, \"We have not engaged in official cooperation through MOUs, ventures, or joint-research\", adding \"there are no people within KRICT who are researching superconductors\".

Best I can tell, 1D superconductivity isn't thought to exist at any temperature, and it's being invoked to explain away problems with a claim to a room-temperature superconductor? The answer to problems with one claim of a massive breakthrough is that they're actually making two massive breakthroughs? This is vanishingly unlikely on priors alone. To be consistent with the data (if you treat the video I think is fake as real), this 1D superconductivity also needs to be present in multiple different ways that are just right. There's just no way: it's a fine-tuned rationalisation, it's a desperate attempt to not be forced to acknowledge the evidence is crap. It should be thrown in the bin. The ideas are being passed around on Twitter along with citations to the arxiv and lots of jargon that is tricking people into thinking they are engaging in the scientific process, but it's a cargo cult imitation of what thinking scientifically (by which I really just mean rationally) looks like.

The suggestion to cut it in two to get better results is also nonsensical, the tilt is caused by imbalance of superconductivity (if it is one) of the sides. Any subsection you may cut will have the same imbalance within it as well. If the latest video that purports to show flux pinning is not a fake, then LK-99 is confirmed as a superconductor. It was a classic display of flux pinning. It was in fact so good that the only way to fake that video would have been to do it with a cryogenic temperature superconductor first and edit the resulting video heavily. A traditional superconductor sample that small would reach Tc within seconds in a room environment and therefore would also require compositing the environment and not just digitally obscuring the \"smoke\" wafting away from the sample."

What kind of instrument error could result in this.  And then to have the extremely-low resistance be replicated (albeit at a lower temp), should lend credence to their results.  It's likely that grain alignment (as Iris has explained in elaborate detail on twitter) can account for the shift in Tc thanks to synthesis differences."

FWIW we aren't ruling out type I because the material doesn't perfectly expel magnetic fields (I don't know if it does), we're ruling it out due to our theoretical understanding of type I superconductivity, which says they can't exist at temperatures this high. We could always be wrong about that, but also unlikely. And empirically, the hottest type I superconductors are much colder than the hottest type II superconductors.

      "text": "The original LK-99 paper describes the use of annealing to produce a material with superior mechanical properties. Annealing is a process that involves heating a material and then cooling it slowly. This process can be used to improve the mechanical properties of the material, such as tensile strength and hardness. The attempted replication of LK-99 at Peking University used sintering rather than annealing. Sintering is a process that involves heating a powdered material until the particles stick together to form a solid. This process can be used to produce complex parts with shapes that would be difficult or impossible to produce by other methods. However, sintering does not produce the same mechanical properties as annealing. In conclusion, annealing and sintering are two different materials manufacturing processes. Annealing is a slower and more expensive process, but it produces a material with superior mechanical properties. Sintering is a faster and cheaper process, but it does not produce the same mechanical properties as annealing."

Why does Iris's graphite not hover (partially, with something stabilising it)? And you have to take into account the field strength, no? The magnet used in the LK-99 demo is quite chunky. I don't know how surface field strength scales with size of rare earth magnets - but if they're 20\u00d7 stronger than than those used to levitate graphite, then they could cause something 20\u00d7 denser but equally diamagnetic to hover, no? Note also that the quadrupole arrangement in the graphite levitation demos mean that the actual field strength is significantly reduced compared to a dipolar field - the middle of the piece of graphite is in zero field, even. So we're seeing ability to levitate despite much smaller average magnetic fields over the material. Again, this means the possibility that the LK-99 video has 20\u00d7 stronger fields is pretty plausible - it's a huge magnet and not in a quadrupole arrangement."

I would want to see an independent expert confirm that the partial floating we see in the Korean group's videos, if due to diamagnetism, would require very strong diamagnetism. This seems like an obvious point to make if you're a condensed matter physicist looking into this, and I've seen nobody credible make it, so am increasingly assuming it's simply false. And even if that's true it doesn't prove much - the videos of impressive partial levitation  have been \"reproduced\"  as a joke with what looks like a fridge magnet. We would need to know it's actual diamagnetism before we could conclude that it is strong diamagnetism. I am increasingly assuming we're not even seeing diamagnetism in the Korean or other videos of partial levitation, and that not only is LK-99 not record-breakingly diamagnetic, it's barely diamagnetic at all. Comparison to levitating pyrolytic graphite videos is misleading -  a qaudrupole field made out of four magnets, necessary for full diamagnetic levitation to be stable, is much weaker than the field from a dipole magnet we're seeing the partial levitation videos use. Pyrolytic graphite doesn't partially float if you put it over a dipole magnet, it completely flies away. I imagine if you weighed it down with its volume once or twice over in lead, maybe then it would drag one edge on the magnet and be able to not fly off... I don't think the surface-area point is that relevant - that's just how pyrolytic graphite is produced and an extended object is necessary for stabilisation in the quadrupole arrangement (you sometimes even see them with holes cut out of the middle of the graphite, because there's no magnetic field and thus no force right in the middle, so that's dead-weight). If anyone thinks it is very diamagnetic, they can make some mana here:"

[1] talks of how the material could in theory allow for SC, if only there was something to give it a 'kick', but are unsure on how one would achieve that. [2] talks of how the addition of oxygen via annealing the sample in an oxygen rich environment at the final stages of synthesis, could enable the SC capability of the material. It effectively that the addition of the oxygen gives the material an added 'kick'. \"we may conclude that the hybridization between the Cu d-states of the Cu doped with the p state of the fully occupied 1/4 occupied O1 atoms may be the key for the realization of the room temperature superconductivity\" Call it Hopium/Copium, but the original Korean papers are already so immensely vague and storied in their publication, that really anything could have/have not happened, for them to have gotten the results they did. So a method that could so easily happen by accident (exposing the material to air during synthesis) may well have happened to them, and is what gave them the results they published. It could be interesting if the team from [1] re-did their analysis on the composition proposed by [2], and see if they get the 'kick' they theorise.

Manifold is convenient, as can be seen by my impulse buying $200. Next, I am already betting on real money market! Namely KOSDAQ 065350 Shinsung Delta Tech, which owns 5% of Quantum Energy Research Centre by proxy. Now I will be accused of stock shill, oh well. This market is so so much much larger than everything else, about $1B is involved. Realistically, I pretty much can't influence it by posting to Manifold. It is mainly moved by things like KBS broadcast. 2) How much should I bet? Even if my probability of RTAPSC is 20%, that is not probability of QERC winning. After all, 1986 REBCO HTS is yet to significantly change the world. I apply 70% discount for REBCO-like difficulty in application and another 70% for how defensible QERC patent is, resulting in 10% probability of QERC winning. I somewhat arbitrarily estimate value of QERC-with-RTAPSC-win at $200B. Then value of SDT share is $10B, giving 10x return. With Kelly bet, I should bet 1% for 10% chance of 10x return. I have $100K disposable cash and I in fact invested $1K to SDT. I am in fact comfortably profitable at current price but do not plan to exit the market. $200 here is impulse spend for my hobby which I am starting to regret. 3) Why secrecy? First, some of you asked for screenshots and here it is:  https://gall.dcinside.com/thesingularity/345635 . There were in fact multiple deleted posts but this is the main one. Next, the nature of private information I mentioned on Twitter. (I got okay for this.) I am talking to someone (who doesn't want to be identified) who is working at a Korean lab (which also doesn't want to be identified but verified to my satisfaction, with photographs and videos of lab and lab equipment) which in fact already received samples from the Korean lab (which also doesn't want to be identified) which made the announcement at China-Korea Thin Film Symposium. I have seen photographs and videos of this sample's interesting magnetic properties, such as levitation and suspension (upside down) in magnetic field. It is qualitatively similar to those of what came from China. To summarize, I am very sure 1. Samples with interesting magnetic properties were synthesized in a Korean lab 2. Said Korean lab made an announcement at China-Korea Thin Film Symposium 3. Said Korean lab followed through its promise and distributed samples. As for secrecy, my sources simply don't want to be identified, yet, in public. South Korean superconductivity community is extremely small and you just need a very few bits to identify person or lab. Recently South Korean police charged a crazy person (surprisingly a somewhat high ranking civil servant working at City of Bucheon) who incited violence at the very forum (dcinside) we are talking about in words such as \"let's meet with weapons and go to Songpa\". According to police, he stated that he was disgruntled because he lost ~$100K from his superconductivity-related stock investments. Reporting at  https://v.daum.net/v/20230823081948927 .

The orientation is just as pinned as the position, it should not be rotating like that. It should be trying to maintain a fixed distance from the magnet and maintaining its orientation. Turning on its edge is exactly what it would do it it was trying to maximise its average distance to the magnet, though, if it was experiencing simple repulsion.

The semiconductor industry by comparison controls areas of applied doping down to nanometers with highly exact ratios of atoms. The fact that a few milligrams of a much larger samples are behaving differently and exhibiting these behaviors just goes to show a lack of purity or orientation uniformity. Levitation and resistivity could both be impacted by purity (if the material produced is correct) and orientation (are strands with the material in or out of alignment with others). I can't say what exactly would be required for each, but capabilities should be proportional to both ratio of SC to non-SC material and the alignment of that SC material there is. Small alignment issues in only 2 dimensions  could greatly reduce effeciency which is much more apparent on the scale of superconductors."

The interesting thing about superconductors is that when they go into the superconducting state, a gap opens and so there is a jump in the heat capacity. They make no attempt to even measure this, so this figure is pointless. I\u2019ve worked a lot with research on superconductors and their data does not follow standard known theory for superconducting behaviour. Clearly, significantly more data is needed and this should be obvious to any trained scientist. I get that they are not from a superconductivity background, but this is just terrible scientific practice."

If I had only succeeded at producing a small number of successful samples and hadn't succeeded at getting a reputable journal to publish a paper, it seems completely reasonable to hang onto the majority of samples while working on more compelling data and research.  It's also clear that videos demonstrating properties of LK-99 have been insufficient to sway public perception, so additional video demonstrations don't seem like they would clear up uncertainty.

They only owe a proof to the peer reviewers at N/S, or to any potential investors. If they really have a RTSC, they don't really care if public believes it 1 month earlier or later.

I think I can see how the hype cycle is feeding itself, and that this is happening due to human nature and not due to a good prospect of RTAPSCs. It has also come to light that the impressive partial hover could be something as boring as ferromagnetism, and that since nobody outside of the Korean group can access those samples, the probability of those demonstrations being fraudulent has increased.

Maybe it might move a teensy bit due to the friction at the contact point but it wouldn't look anything like this. Mere diamagnets react to changes in magnetic field. Rotating the magnet doesn't change the magnetic field so there should not be any reaction. It seems to me that the degree to which it lifts itself of the magnet is set by the dominant alignment of the 1D superconducting channels which also pin the LK99 in place which explains the various angles at which we see these things stand up. One the magnetic field aligns with the channels the field is expelled and no further change in the orientation can occur. That's actually bad news for anyone hoping for a quick route to superconductive energy storage. If the bulk is only superconductive along one lattice dimension it is going to be a lot harder to make tapes out of this stuff.

And they run conductivity measurements of the whole dirty pellet where they \"carefully removed these components with non-magnetic tweezers\" (this sounds like a joke). To sum up: they themselves confirm that only a small portion of the sample is supposedly LK-99 (reacting to the magnet) while the most is just some random stuff.  And all the measurements look EXACTLY how it would look like if we had a superconductor in some semiconducting slightly ferromagnetic matrix! No superconductivity since there is no percolation, slight ferromagnetic response from the matrix and a very stron diamagnetic response from the SC particles. Again, it all aligns with what they report themselves. Thank you for cheap \"yes\" options"

For example, if you have 2 magnets, you can of course get them to join and they'll be joined in any orientation and remain joined regardless of gravity.  But as in your imgur video, they will typically \"snap\" together at a specific point where the magnetic attraction is strongest.  This would not explain pinning at an angle remaining in place in any orientation like in the picture from this Indian team, especially not when taken in conjunction with the video evidence from the same Indian team showing their replication also pinned upright in the same position no matter where they move it along the regular magnet.  There is no \"snapping\" to a preferred spot of greatest magnetic attraction/repulsion.  A combination of materials could possibly explain the upright pinning as was demonstrated a few days ago in a Twitter video by finding the perfect balance of materials to counteract gravity in just the right way.  However, that same force would be expected to make it fall to the ground when turned upside down without quantum locking, and such a ferromagnetic material certainly would not be expected to stay in the same position as it was moved around a magnet. ChatGPT does a better job of explaining these important distinctions: The explanation you've provided brings out the distinction between two behaviors well: Given the descriptions you've shared: Thus, based on your description, the behavior is more consistent with quantum locking than with simple magnetic attraction from ferromagnetic inclusions. If true, it would indicate that the material has superconducting properties and engages in flux pinning. However, to definitively claim this, controlled experimental tests and detailed material analyses would be necessary."

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the conduction electrons are from the doped Cu atoms with valence close to d9. Motivated by this picture, we build a two-orbital Hubbard model on triangular lattice formed by the dxz and dyz orbitals with total hole density (summed over spin and orbital) n = 1 \u2212 p. When p = 0, the system is in a Mott insulator within this model. When p > 0, we derive a t\u2212J model and perform a self-consistent slave boson mean field calculation. Interestingly we find a s wave pairing in contrast to one-orbital t-J model which favors d + id pairing. S wave pairing should be more robust to disorder and may lead to high Tc superconductor with sufficiently large value of t and J. However, the DFT calculations predict a very small value of t and then the Tc is expected to be small. If LK99 is really a high Tc superconductor, ingredients beyond the current model is needed. We conjecture that the doped Cu atoms may distort the original lattice and form local clusters with smaller Cu-Cu distance and thus larger value of t and J. Within these clusters we may locally apply our t-J model calculation and expect high Tc s-wave superconductor. Then the superconducting islands couple together, which may eventually become a global superconductor, an insulator or even an anomalous metal depending on sample details. Does not look good."

Imagine someone claims he's discovered a  procedure to convert lead to gold.  Our modern day scientists would try to perform the procedure, fail to replicate, and conclude it's fake, or that they made a mistake, or that it's theoretically possible but blah blah blah.  But that is already giving too much credence. Just give the guy some lead and challenge him to convert it to gold. The lk-99 researchers did everything they could to put the responsibility on the public to work, evaluate, etc. When in fact we should put it on them. Viewed in this way their claim is easy to understand as false, without any science or replication attempts, within the first few days.

According to certain Twitter circles, apparently it must be a 1D superconductor, even though the authors didn't claim that. Because that would rescue (probably wouldn't, but folks have convinced themselves it would) the superconductivity claim from discrepancies between expected magnetic levitation and what we actually see. But then the fake video comes out of full levitation and now the 1D superconducting strands must be criss-crossed in that sample, or something, to explain why it hovers differently to the partially-levitating flecks! 1D superconductivity is amazing, seems like it can explain any observation at all! Really incredible stuff."

You can't do anything with HN rep but people are very strict on themselves about posting & rewarding good posts. Here the currency is similarly visible as a profile of who you are, and it's a percentage not a sum, so even more meaningful than the simple \"total accumulated rep\" sites like hn, reddit, etc. It's more of a batting average.   Pre-twitter monetization many high-follower twitter accounts are only very marginally useful, and not monetarily.  The answer is status and reputation, even for a fake identity. Those motivations apply to everyone, whether they monetize, whether they're anon or not. It's an ego thing. That's an explanation why people would work hard for play money and I think it validates there potentially being useful information here.

We have 3 elements redox (Cu, S and P change oxidation states) plus doping (Cu in place of Pb). And you have to hit the sweet spot with all three controlling only one parameter (chemicals ratio). As a result you get a mixture of some shit where may be some little crystallites of superconducting phase. So you break an ampule, grind what you get, hover a magnet and see which particles react: they are just single crystallites of your potential superconductor"

      "text": "2023-08-07 18:37:56 Google Translation of Article from today in Seoul Economic Daily: Source:   https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/29TBDDJJPG Translation: While skeptical views are spreading in the academic world over 'LK-99', a normal-temperature and normal-pressure superconductor material that domestic researchers claim to have developed for the first time in the world, the Quantum Energy Research Institute, the developer, has verified samples (samples) made by foreign researchers. As it was before the loss, he expressed his position that he would not care about such skepticism. An official from the Quantum Energy Research Institute said in a phone call with the Seoul Economic Daily on the 7th, \u201cWe do not share joy with (external) opinions saying that it was reproduced through experiments or that it was not.\u201d The development team is in a position that it is difficult to trust because the samples produced by external institutions and laboratories for the reproduction of LK-99 have not been verified. The official continued, \"Since there are many opinions coming out from the academic world, we will collect them and make an official announcement at the end of this month or early next month.\" Some observe that the Quantum Energy Research Institute will officially announce the results of the thesis review of the international academic journal 'APL Materials', which is currently undergoing the registration process, at the end of this month at the comprehensive announcement. While opinions are divided over the claim to develop normal-temperature and normal-pressure superconductors, a skeptical view prevails in the academic world. This is because a number of domestic and foreign researchers have tried to verify LK-99 and are expressing opinions that the material may not be a superconductor. This is because samples were made according to the manufacturing method suggested by the Quantum Energy Research Institute and properties related to superconductors, such as electrical resistance and the Meissner effect (the property of a superconductor to float on a magnet), were measured, but significant results could not be confirmed. Taiwanese media Free Times reported on the 6th (local time) that a research team led by Professor Limin Wang of National Taiwan University made LK-99 samples and tested them from the 1st to the 5th of this month, but could not reproduce the superconductor. Professor Wang told the media, \u201cThe sample showed some diamagnetism, but it did not conform to superconductivity and zero resistance was not observed. . Previously, the international journal Nature also introduced similar cases on the 4th, saying, \u201cThe initial efforts of the researchers to reproduce the claims of the Korean research team did not live up to expectations, and the researchers have a deep sense of skepticism.\u201d However, as a counterargument to this, some claim that it is necessary to first verify that the samples are made exactly according to the LK-99 manufacturing method. Kim Hyeon-tak, a research professor at the University of William and Mary, who participated in the development of LK-99, also revealed his position through the foreign press that 'incomplete reproduction is due to incomplete samples'. An official from the scientific community explained, \u201cThe surest way to secure the reliability of a sample is to receive it directly from the development team, and if not, the next best way is to produce it in-house and then have it verified by the development team or a third party.\u201d Accordingly, the Korea Superconducting and Low Temperature Society, in which Kim Chang-young, vice-director of the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) Strong Interrelated Materials Research Center and professor of physics and astronomy at Seoul National University, chaired the verification committee, recently started verifying LK-99, using samples provided by the Quantum Energy Research Institute and samples produced by themselves. Although they announced their plan to cross-verify, they did not receive a response to the sample request from the Quantum Energy Research Institute until today. Currently, only the Korea Energy Engineering University, which has signed a business agreement with the Quantum Energy Research Institute, is receiving and analyzing samples."

      "text": "My post has caused a stir, so I'll write down why I reached this conclusion on my way to work. This judgment was based on the data presented by both the LK-99 proponents and opponents. The main lines of reasoning are as follows: 1. Anyone who synthesizes this substance correctly should produce needle-like microcrystals, and the actual sample obtained is a mixture of these. 2. As I have previously written, my confidence in room-temperature superconductivity is seen in the cliff-like drop in resistance just above Tc in the temperature-dependent resistance graph. This substance can never be a bad metal in terms of band structure, so it must be a superconductor, and experimentally, Tc is 400K. 3. The remaining issues include the increase in resistance at temperatures slightly above Tc and the resistance that is clearly a signal below Tc. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility graph also gradually increases at low temperatures depending on the sample. 4. A point continually raised by the LK-99 opponents, claiming it to be a scam, is that the video purporting to show the Meissner effect actually demonstrates the properties of a ferromagnet, not the Meissner effect. I agree with this. 5. Then, seeing a video Andrew McCalip posted showing off specimens baked from high-purity materials, about six needle-like samples presumed to be LK-99 sprang up when exposed to a magnet. When the magnet was moved, half of the needle samples followed the magnet, and the other half were repelled. Evidence of a mix of ferromagnetism and room-temperature superconductivity? The samples will be sent to USC for analysis, he said. 6. News of a failure to reproduce LK-99 at Peking University suggests that the sample appears to be a mix of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials. 7. The incontrovertible evidence presented by both sides is simply true, but the only solution that can satisfy all these facts is that the actual sample must consist of room-temperature superconductors, ferromagnetic substances, and mediocre crystals distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution. 8. In conclusion, an intriguing material has been discovered in lead apatite, where the substitution of copper for lead results in either a room-temperature superconductor, a ferromagnet, or some insulating substance. 9. My service ends here, so if you want to ask anything else, pay up and ask. This case is a victory for the cowboy researchers."

My previous belief that I should further bet into this market any referral-mana earned by advertising this market, so as not to set myself poor incentives where I can win even if I'm wrong, has been messing with my head and trading patterns in this.  (Especially since I thought last night that I'd executed a trade in another market that would've put me in the black, but found when I went to sell that position that the purchase I'd clicked on hadn't gone through.  I'm not very cheerful about the disposition of the rest of my click-in mana, resting on whether I'm net in the black on things generally; that sets up nonepistemic incentives that I should've foreseen earlier.) I'll consider what to do about my earlier commitment, but definitely revoke that commitment with respect to referral mana going forward. I learn the larger lesson:  It's important not to introduce more complicated other incentives that potentially push away from the epistemic incentives on prediction markets, in the course of trying to get rid of current possible incentive-gotchas.  The suggestion I got that I should bet my referral mana on my existing position, to meet my expressed desire to make sure I didn't \"win either way\", initially seemed to me just; and it was simple and I could do it immediately, so I did that; but actually any departure from the purity of \"only ever bet mana in a way that solely reflects your belief\" is not healthy. I wish:  That there was a simple way to see how much referral mana I earned on this market, over what time period, and disentangle that from all other earnings and referrals from all other markets etc."

Point 2 - Some people outside of the lab have reported to have seen the data that proves that lk-99 is the real deal. Point-3 - The korean organization responsible for the investigating the claims as not deliberated yet. Point 4 - No replications of lk-99 as a thin film, authors seem to argue that the superconducting behaviour is present in both bulk and thin film samples but that it is much more reliable as a thin film."

The Korean team stated that LK-99 is: Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O (0.9<x<1.1) Meaning, the actual composition can vary between 0.9 and 1.1 of the numbers shown. The Indian team doing their reproduction have stated they produced this: Pb9Cu(PO4)6O This team subsequently went on to not produce any levitation or zero resistivity in their testing. I believe that this balancing of the equation is very far off the mark, however it does appear to be a rather difficult equation to balance. The Korean team do not in any part of their two papers specify an exacting composition, thus I believe the reason why we don't have floating rocks, and more floating specks and grains, is because those are the only, tiny fragments of the synthesis which fused together in the correct composition, and thus the primary issue with reproducing the findings, is entirely with synthesis, and achieving the exact stoichiometry, which means lots and lots of trial and error.

In an e-mail interview with Newsis on the 4th, Prof. Kim expressed this, adding \"I don't think this sort of organizational high-handedness is an appropriate thing to do to a bunch of people who are trying to do a business based on hard-earned loans\". ... In regards to the position of the Society, Prof. Kim has asserted that \"I'm fine with them amking conclusions, but I think they can just make their own samples and verify themselves\". He appeared to have been conscious of the controversies surrounding the authenticity of the paper, as well as the craze surrounding relevant investment products, adding \"We have never gone around promoting our findings. All we haev done is submit a paper, to research and get published, just like any other researcher Source: https://www.newsis.com/view/?id=NISX20230804_0002401890 [LINK PREVIEW] [\ub2e8\ub3c5]\ucd08\uc804\ub3c4\uccb4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ucc38\uc5ec\uc790 \"\uc0d8\ud50c \uc694\uccad? \uac80\uc99d\uc704 \ud68c\uc758\ub85d\u00b7\uac80\uc99d\uacc4\ud68d\uc11c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub77c\""

I think most rational actors in this space should be skeptical and pessimistic. Regardless, it is obvious to me that there is remaining science to be done here before a scientific consensus could be reached -- namely evaluation of the materials created by the LK-99 team. The reproduction process is clearly underspecified in the preprint documents. If your claim was 'There is scientific consensus that the material produced via the process as outlined in the preprint is not a bulk RTSC', I would agree. If reproduction attempts had achieved properties identical to those outlined in the paper, and then were able to explain how it is not a RTSC, I think the science would be settled. No one has achieved the same resistivity curves. There are experts who have stated that the graphs in the original papers are hard to explain in the absence of superconductivity. It's possible that pure LK-99 is just incredibly finicky to produce (and there is a theoretical underpinning for this being true). It's possible that even when produced purely and with all the observed behavior, the scientists made an error in concluding that this behavior was evidence of it being a RTSC, and there is some alternate explanation. It's possible that there is some form of fraud and the data is fake. None of these possibilities can be eliminated until the samples are verified externally.  It's important to distinguish scientific likelihood from scientific fact."

      "text": "here is the full article text (via google translate). If the translation is correct, this read as total fluff to me, mostly press about a group verifying the crystal structure with journalistic framing around the importance of that with vague sentences about future potential. ---- Researchers at Korea University of Energy and Technology confirmed that the crystal structure of a sample of 'LK-99', a new material developed in Korea, is the same as the crystal structure presented in the paper. The College of Energy Engineering is the only external institution that is conducting research after receiving samples of LK-99 made by the Quantum Energy Research Institute. As domestic and foreign research institutes fail to reproduce LK-99 one after another, skepticism about the research results is spreading, and it is noteworthy that the basic reliability of the thesis has been confirmed. However, the confirmation of the microcrystalline structure and the verification of the superconducting properties are not related. A researcher at Korea Energy Engineering University, who is participating in the LK-99 study, said in a phone call with the Digital Times on the 8th, \"As a result of analyzing the X-ray diffraction structure of the sample, it was confirmed that the fine crystal structure of the sample is the same as that presented in the paper.\" said. The researcher said, \"If you look at the microcrystalline structure, you can estimate the possibility even if you cannot confirm the physical properties of the material. As a result of confirming the microcrystalline structure with X-rays for the analysis of LK-99, the Quantum Energy Research Institute has a different crystal structure and The crystal structure confirmed in the sample was the same,\u201d he said. Until now, there have been claims that researchers in China and India have succeeded in reproducing LK-99, but none of the X-ray crystal structures reported in the thesis have been confirmed. This is the first case of an external institution confirming the microcrystalline structure of the LK-99 sample. X-ray crystal structure is used to see the microscopic crystal structure of proteins and new materials. In organic matter, we mainly look at the structure at the molecular level. The samples made by the Quantum Energy Research Institute were reported to have received a passing grade from the researchers at the College of Energy in terms of purity, uniformity, and reproducibility. This means that material synthesis has reached a stable trajectory. However, the official said, \"Whether it is a superconductor or not is a matter for the scientific community to reveal, and we are only interested in its electrical properties. As the material has reached a level worth systematic analysis, it is made into a thin film with excellent applicability to explore the possibility of application in the energy field. plan to do,\" he said. The College of Energy Engineering began research by receiving samples from the Quantum Energy Research Institute about a month ago. Following the X-ray structural analysis, materials are being analyzed with a high-performance TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope), which is currently only three in the world. TEM cannot confirm the superconducting properties, but it can see the crystal structure more precisely down to the atomic level. If the structure is revealed at this level, it may be possible to predict the properties of the material through computer simulation. \"Even if it is not superconducting, there are many applications for new materials that are very inexpensive and have very low resistance at room temperature,\" said the researcher. Following structural analysis at the atomic level, electrical properties and some electro-optical properties will also be confirmed. Final results are expected by the end of the year. To this end, it plans to mobilize all possible technologies such as semiconductor analysis equipment. Regarding the fact that the characteristics and internal structure are very different despite the fact that foreign researchers have successfully produced LK-99 samples, this researcher said that it is because of the characteristics of ceramic compounds. Since the process of making ceramic compounds is similar to baking pottery, even if the same materials are used, the result varies depending on the maker. He also said that the company has its own know-how that was not included in the thesis. The Quantum Energy Research Institute developed this material six years ago, but it had a lot of byproducts, so the purity and reproducibility were low, but it raised the level for six years. The researcher said, \"Among the studies conducted by foreign researchers, the theoretical research results presented by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States are meaningful. The possibility was confirmed through computer simulation based on the materials and conditions disclosed in the thesis.\" We are working on research with the hope that new materials may emerge,\u201d he said. reporter glasses"

      "text": "Full translation of:  https://m.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2023080802109931650002   The Energy Engineering department's research team in Korea has confirmed that the crystal structure of the domestically developed new material 'LK-99' sample is the same as the one proposed in the paper. The Energy Engineering department is the only external institution currently studying the LK-99 sample created by the Quantum Energy Research Institute. While skepticism about the research results has spread as both domestic and foreign research institutions have failed to reproduce LK-99, it is noteworthy that the basic reliability of the paper has been confirmed. However, the confirmation of the microcrystalline structure and the verification of superconductivity properties are unrelated. A researcher from the Energy Engineering department, who is participating in the LK-99 research, stated in a call with Digital Times on the 8th that \"From the X-ray diffraction analysis of the sample, we confirmed that the microcrystalline structure of the sample is the same as what is presented in the paper.\" The researcher said, \"Even if we can't confirm the physical properties of the material by looking at the microcrystalline structure, we can estimate the possibilities. As a result of verifying the microcrystalline structure of LK-99 with X-rays for analysis, the crystal structure stated in the paper and the crystal structure confirmed in the sample were the same.\" So far, research teams in China and India have claimed to have successfully reproduced LK-99, but no one has confirmed the X-ray crystal structure reported in the paper. This is the first case where an external institution has confirmed the microcrystalline structure of the LK-99 sample. X-ray crystallography is used to view the microcrystalline structure of proteins and new materials. In organic materials, it is mainly used to look at structures at the molecular level. The sample made by the Quantum Energy Research Institute received a passing grade from the Energy Engineering research team in terms of purity, uniformity, and reproducibility. This means that material synthesis has reached a stable trajectory. However, this official stated, \"Whether it's a superconductor or not is something for the scientific community to reveal, and we are only interested in electrical properties. Now that the material has reached a level worth systematically analyzing, we plan to explore the potential for energy field applications by creating it in a thin film form, which has excellent applicability.\" The Energy Engineering department started research about a month ago after receiving samples from the Quantum Energy Research Institute. They plan to make LK-99 into a thin film a few micrometers thick and mainly verify how low the room temperature electrical resistance can go. After X-ray structural analysis, the material is being analyzed with a high-performance Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), of which there are only three in the world. TEM cannot confirm superconductivity, but it can view the crystal structure more precisely, down to the atomic level. If the structure is revealed to this level, it may be possible to predict the properties of the material through computer simulation. The researcher said, \"Even if it's not a superconductor, if it's a new material that is very cheap and has very low resistance at room temperature, there are many applications.\" After analyzing the structure at the atomic level, they plan to confirm the electrical properties and some electro-optical properties. The final results are expected to be out by the end of the year. For this, they plan to mobilize all possible technologies, including semiconductor analysis equipment. Regarding the fact that the properties and internal structure vary greatly even though foreign research teams have announced the successful production of the LK-99 sample, this researcher said it was due to the nature of ceramic compounds. Ceramic compounds, similar to the process of baking pottery, can produce different results even using the same materials, depending on the maker. The researcher also mentioned that there is company-specific know-how that is not included in the paper. The Quantum Energy Research Institute developed this material six years ago, but it had a lot of by-products, resulting in low purity and reproducibility. However, they have improved the level over the past six years. This researcher said, \"I believe the theoretical research results presented by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States during the research by foreign researchers are significant. They confirmed the possibilities through computer simulation based on the material and conditions disclosed in the paper.\" They added, \"We are conducting research with hope that new materials created for the first time in the world could emerge from our country.\" Reporter An Kyung Ae  naturean@dt.co.kr"

Even manifold stayed below 50% for a majority of the time.

Even Chinese state-run media, which previously criticized Korea, is now mentioning Korea-China friendship and camaraderie - sparking interest within Korea on the reasons and context behind this. Previously, LK99 was leaked when a disgruntled employee publicly released a draft paper without permission after leaving the Korean research team. The issue is that the paper contained the recipe. The original plan was to validate it at the Korea University of Energy and Technology before releasing it publicly - at least 6 months later. For now, LK99 has been unintentionally made public. And the departed employee (Kwon Yong-wan) only knew part of the manufacturing process. Professor Kim Hyun-tak, one of the researchers, recently clarified in media interviews that \"core know-how has not been exposed.\" However, an unverified LK99 video was released yesterday in China. There are concerned voices from Korean online communities."

But my impression is they can be impacted by a number of things, especially impurities / doping, and that magnetic fields wouldn't be outside the question. I'm fairly sure the current dependence makes sense in that context. I'm assuming it's a localized heating effect with runaway, because the low-resistance path is a thin and delicate path between connected Cu2S regions of the sample. But that's not a strong prediction, it could be something else. High-quality temperature control and uniformity is not a thing the original papers demonstrated; phase-pure samples with better measurement are in the followup non-replication papers. But more broadly:  some  basic measurement errors in the original papers have been essentially proven at this point. Those are measurement errors the original authors should have caught, IMO, especially given the length of time they were working on this. That says to me that it's fairly reasonable to expect to find more measurement errors if we keep looking."

Also, given how big of a deal this discovery will be, very well funded labs with incredible researchers all over the world have spent decades looking for it. So quite a few avenues have been explored over the years. From this I add that the prior of any claim of a  simple  process is also low. So without a significant update for why this preprint specifically holds significant merit I'll take a pretty strong NO on >30%. I guess the parallel most here would vibe here is if some unknown AI lab released a rough preprint without much data saying \"we just solved alignment!

      "text": "One chinese professor named Yao Yao of South China University of Technology give a explain why lk-99 is always semi floating. he say he will submit to arrive soon. here is the link of draft idea: https://www.zhihu.com/question/615674819/answer/3150568041 I gave a GPT translation : The origin is as follows. My students, after conducting research, found a model in PRL that might be suitable for explaining all the semi-floating experiments observed so far. The model looks something like this: the polarization intensity here can be calculated by breaking the symmetry, and eventually, a set of parameters related to the floating angle should be obtained. The more troublesome part, which we are trying to figure out, is which phases will have unidirectional aggregation of vortices, and the simulation will take some time. Our theoretical work is mainly to find some common experimental phenomena and clarify the principles behind them. Today, after seeing the second floating experiment of the Korean team and the floating experiment of this American netizen, this commonality is very strong, which further strengthens our ideas. Everyone has studied junior high school physics, and material rotation requires the action of a torque. All the semi-floating experiments observed so far have a common feature, that is, one end is attached to the magnet, and the other end will rotate with the movement of the magnet. The only thing that can produce such a strong torque is the magnetic field itself. If you put a piece of pyrolytic graphite, it will float weakly as a whole, but it will not always have a fixed angle attached to the magnet, let alone rotate with your magnet. Not only that, we also observed a detail, that is, LK99 will freely oscillate up and down around the tangent of the contact point, as if there is no damping. This is also a point that many people strongly questioned at the beginning, because the usual superconductors will form magnetic flux pinning, and there will be basically no vibration. So our theory needs to explain the following points: 1. Why is there always one end (it seems to be always the big one) attached to the magnet? 2. Why can the other end lift up, or even bounce up? 3. Why can it freely oscillate up and down around the tangent? The theoretical explanation is never unique, we usually choose the most minimum one. In my opinion, to explain these phenomena, this model must introduce the following elements: 1. It must be one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional, and it is impossible for two-dimensional or three-dimensional to have one direction that is almost free (under the premise that the magnetic field has occupied one direction). 2. Parity must be broken, that is, the left and right sides are not symmetrical, so that the magnetic field always tends to choose one side. 3. Both diamagnetism and paramagnetism must be considered so that one side repels and the other side attracts. Let me explain the last point. Why not just put a small magnet on it? Because the external magnetic field acts on the small magnet, the force is generally collinear, and it will not produce torque, let alone vibration. The non-collinear magnetic field is more complicated, try to be minimum. Introducing diamagnetism can use the effect of magnetic flux pinning, making it move with the magnetic field, and the principle is similar to superconductivity. The rest of the explanation is simple. On a diamagnetic background (such as the Meissner state), try to induce some reverse vortices, which show paramagnetism. In the case of parity breaking, make them gather in a certain direction, such as the contact point, thereby generating a certain attraction. The other side is still mainly diamagnetic, so it naturally floats. For a two-dimensional system, if the entire lattice rotates up and down at this time, it will obviously feel damping, which is the pinning of superconductivity. But the one-dimensional system is special, the transverse chiral current in the Meissner state is all 0, so there is no damping. This is the same principle as the one-dimensional Ising model has no spontaneous magnetization, but the two-dimensional one does. Because to form a ring in one dimension, you must traverse the entire chain, while in two dimensions, you only need a minimum of four grid points, which is a ring. Finally, any theory is just a word of one's own, it is what we think is a more reasonable explanation. Whether it is right or not still needs further verification, and we will also adjust our model continuously with the deepening of experimental reproduction.

Does any of this get affected if somebody produces a gold-doped variation that promises to be actually useful as a superconductor for sensors, clearly vindicating LK and setting them up for a Nobel; but the original LK samples weren't superconducting material so much as material with a few superconducting tunnels? Does your view on this change if, conversely, as of the end of 2024, it looks like there's no prospect of practical uses; and LK's material doesn't look any  more  superconducting (at RTAP) than what current suspicion says about eg silver particles embedded in a gold matrix? Suppose that there's no great hope of practical use, LK's material doesn't look more superconducting than equally strong suspicions about gold nanowires or whatev, and furthermore replications measure resistivity above what the graph in the original paper showed, implying that at least some of LK's measurements were in error and have failed to replicate? Suppose that some of LK's measurements were in error and failed to replicate, and there's no useful superconducting wire at the end of 2024;  but  experts seem substantially more hopeful about future gold-doped materials (or whatever) than they do about gold nanowires or whatev?

Poster got it via via on Telegram, wants to know the actual source. Video datestamp in the left top corner says it was filmed yesterday. The only way I can think of that this isn't the real deal is if someone chipped a flake of some YBCO or bisko, cooled it with liquid nitrogen, finnicked around with a pair of tweezers, placed it near this magnet and shot this 5 second video without either the air or the tweezers warming op the flake before it lost its superconductivity again. Quite a feat. Anyone got any other theories?"

They're just moving the magnet around a bit below, and rotation is the easiest way for the fleck to get as much of itself away from the strongest part of the field as it can. Drag the magnet along the bottom of the beaker and show the fleck is attracted to it as it moves away and not just repelled as it moves close, and then we'd be talking.,"

Imagine you are a South Korean researcher working on this for 5-10 years already, and this is real - you  really do have a piece of Superconducting LK-99  in your kitchen drawer. (You worked on it so long, and a few times accidentally took a piece home, which you still have). You woke up this morning and go online.  Nearly nobody believes you. Your job prospects are looking bad.  Your facebook [SK equivalent] has about 8000 comments and hundreds of new FRs from journalists in SK and the world.  Your email has invitations from journalists for interviews, requests for samples, friendly messages, supporting messages from fans...  Your name was trending on twitter [or SK variant] with hundreds of people calling you a hero at first - proud compatriots... but now, they just call you a liar, a disgrace, a shame to your nation, your university, yourself and to science. Your mom and father and old professors have all emailed you asking what's going on.  Mother reminds you she told you not to waste time on this.  But you  know  it is real, you've seen it!  How dare she doubt, now that the prize is found! You're angry that people don't believe you! And embarrassed that everyone in the world who knows you is laughing at you (your parents, gf, friends, colleagues).  You're frustrated that  it is real  but nobody believes you.   You can't believe this, it's so unjust. You KNOW you deserve the Nobel prize - yet the world is laughing.  You deserve money, respect, you really do have it and really pushed through those hard research years to get your win, and you DID it.  You thought finding it would be enough to make money, buy a house, improve life, show people you weren't actually wasting your time, you were worthy, etc. But you do  nothing .  You and your 6 colleagues remain absolutely silent - not clarifying anything, not sharing anything, just staying at home in private while your worlds burn. You  could  do an interview, send a sample, make a video. You could anonymously comment with the correct steps to create the material to one of the teams working on it, or to Iris, or anyone involved (There are many).  You could record an anonymous video in Korean explaining your ideas on how to fix it, and add subtitles, and share it. People would listen.  But you simply stay at home, doing nothing. ---- Is this a plausible situation? That these 7 guys  really do have a room temp SC  and yet every single one of them is doing nothing? To me it seems very unlikely.  That they  KNOW  they are right that they  will  be vindicated soon, but do nothing to support themselves? There are three explanations I can think of in the \"it literally is real\" case 1) somehow the researchers think this is okay - they don't mind the condemnation, loss of respect, etc.  Possible but seems very unlikely (especially given that one of them broke ranks to release the 3-author paper).  Maybe they don't mind a few weeks of ill repute because they know that a positive replication or validation attempt will be released soon, and they've shared samples - either just with the known single SK institute, or with other international ones, secretly. 2) something like a legal impediment to sharing information.  A lawsuit, a business deal, a legal order not to share or speak.  And yes these are possible situations.  No real evidence for them, but they could be real.  That's why I think people should be staking out the lab and seeing if the researchers are going in to continue doing work. 3) they do have  something  but don't remember how to make it.  It's either a real room temp SC (in which case they should share it) or it's not, but is weird (still useful, still clears their name to release).  But if the amount of this thing is extremely small, and there are only 1-2 of them, the situation would make some kind of sense, since they'd naturally be reluctant to share it physically.  In this type of situation I'd expect SK government involvement, too, or legal, since possession of it would be so important.  This is also a situation where spying/stealing the sample becomes very important. These special situations could be true - but initially, the researchers appeared to be doing normal science - they submitted the paper for review, the paper contained their procedure, etc.  Initially they  seemed  to want to get credit and share information on how to truly make the material.  So the silence since then is very strange."

About 2000 new users signed up in the past 30 hours -  that's six percent of the entire Manifold userbase, and almost triple the typical daily active user count. In addition, 418,000 mana was purchased on July 31st, I believe that would have been a record had it taken place over a full month, and it took place in a day. So that's an injection of 1.4M mana, most of it in the hands of inexperienced prediction market traders who've just seen good news and headed straight for this market. The more experienced forecasters and traders simply don't have enough mana to counter that, regardless of the strength of their beliefs. It is harder to explain why polymarket is trading similarly with real money, though. But efficient market hypothesis be damned, I think this is all hugely mispriced and I'd bet it down further if I had much liquid mana left to my name."

Also there are some level of risk aversion. And this is why, I think, Metaculus is at ~1%, while Polymarket and Manifold are way higher.

At this stage of Manifold and in this market particularly, it is not clear that the price in this market is expert-dominated rather than wisdom-of-crowds.

The sample should not merely be repelled from magnets, it should sometimes be attracted as well - it should want to maintain its position and orientation in a magnetic field. Nobody has demonstrated this, only repulsion that doesn't preserve orientation. It should be easy to show this - lower a magnet down over the sample, get it really close, then lift it away. Is the sample attracted to the magnet as you move it away? Sure, maybe the force isn't strong enough to lift it, but partially? Similarly to how it can partially lift itself when repelled by a magnet from below? If I saw that I would be all in on YES. Or move the magnet around in the horizontal plane and show that the sample tries to maintain its distance and orientation relative to the magnet. You could sticky-tape the sample to a bottle cap and float it in a tub of water, pushing it and pulling it, and rotating it around with a magnet. The fact that it can't lift its own weight wouldn't matter since the demonstration can be done in the horizontal plane just as well, as long as you remove friction by some means like floating it on water. That's how type II superconductors interact with magnets, and we haven't seen anything that suggests it, and we should have of it were true. We've only seen demonstrations of what looks like diamagnetism. So that's my case for NO."

      "text": "In the discord there's a channel for LK-99. Just my interpretation, but being in a room with serious traders who openly express contempt at the 10% price, and everyone kind of mutually recognizing this, contributed to the price drop.  I do think Scott's summary had a big effect, too. But before this, it was not clear to me that the market makers mostly believed <1%, since they would bound the price at 8/10.  Once it was revealed this was not their true belief, things shifted. And then someone joked \"we should lower the price\" and before you knew it, the buy limit orders were gone and it was a race to the exits, huge sells started showing up as people raced to get out, and the drop was happening. This can be an ephemeral effect... we will know in the end who was right in this case.  But for me, rather than being a manipulation, this was more a realization of what is really going on. (begin intense speculation section, please ignore if you are easily triggered or take things personally. I am not attacking you and I don't think you're a bad person. I'm just remarking on how my personal experience leads me to interpret the situation. If you disagree, that's fine, I'm willing to hear your thoughts too.)  In my life I have noticed that in extreme manipulation situations, leaders tend to not allow their subordinates opportunities to speak freely with each other.  For example, in Theranos, there was extreme secrecy between departments. If my theory is right, this was to prevent common knowledge from forming, that the entire thing was a scam; every department lead may have thought \"well, the company is doing great, but my area has huge red flags and problems; it's my fault, I'llw ork harder, it's probably okay since the other division leads seem positive\". If they'd been allowed to speak privately with each other, they may have developed mutual awareness that leadership was really scammy.  The fact that Theranos leadership regularly spied on all private internal company communications, and let this be a known fact, was another way they exerted pressure against the development of common knowledge. I'd bet in North Korea too, that leadership is quite wary about allowing individuals to speak to each other and develop mutual awareness of situations. High-control thought groups prefer everyone to think they are alone, and that they're the only one who has doubts.  So even when everyone is privately a doubter, there is not a way for those doubts to crystallize.  This is why showmanship in high control orgs is so important - being able to have all the subleaders publicly bow is strong.  And seemingly simple breaks, like a comet (in historical China), or a minor public slip-up, can allow followers to realize that they are not actually alone and can have unexpectedly strong effects. Obviously LK-99 is not a high control group.  The only similarity that I'm suggesting is that perhaps once mutual awareness of each other's actual beliefs was easier to come by, it allowed a precipitation into action.  And, echoing my earlier comments, some people do have a tendency to somewhat \"automatically\" enforce internal rigid belief on themselves.  This is marked by an unwillingness to consider or adjust one's positions, fear of change in oneself, etc.  This is highly speculative.  But I do feel curiosity at the persistence of some of the YES believers here. No malice needed, just trying to understand how human beings think, change, adjust etc and find this situation very interesting."

Based on theoretical underpinnings the team convinced themselves that it should be a RTSC and cherrypicked data to align with this view. C) The claim that LK-99 is a RTSC is a misunderstanding of the observed phenomena. The material may be a diamagnetic semiconductor, or have other unique properties but it's not a RTSC. D) The team created a RTSC, but don't have a repeatable process to create the material. As such we won't see any replications.

Now nobody ever claimed it would work like that, the copper supposedly needs to be substituted only in some very precise positions of the lattice for any of this to work. Now the places where copper should go seem to be thermodynamically unfavourable (not good news). If you just bake the material you just get a sample with copper randomly distributed but with different placement I'm small different cristals inside the bulk. If you grow the cristal like the German paper you get a very nice criatal but copper is still in random places. The way the Koreans argue that they overcome this is by basically trying to make lots of the small cristals, picking the magnetic reacting cristals from the bulk (supposedly the ones that have the copper or a bigger proportiom of the copper in the right place), sort them and reassemble them in a thin film form. This thin film form is more reliably supercondutor.

Sure, they might also attract some degenerate gamblers, but sharps have a strong incentive to correct mispricings.  For instance, I am 90% confident that more than 50% of the people who placed a bet in this market did not know that: Not just that it over-stated odds--it was often wildly swinging just from Andercot or roon or Alex Kaplan tweets. Fair point that n=1 doesn't mean that Manifold is worthless, but I broadly think that for basically every market I've seen on Manifold where real-money counterparts exist, Manifold added no value as a forecast. There have been lots of egregious cases e.g. when markets took like an hour to update after Hunter Biden had already been charged.   I think it  was  overall much worse and is worse for all cases where a real-money market exists; anyone who disagrees can prove me wrong by correcting real-money market prices to Manifold odds whenever there's a discrepancy and making a ton of money by doing so. My tone in my original message was harsher than I intended. I think Manifold provides a lot of value through exposing new people to prediction markets and making it possible to make a market on just about anything, but I remain very skeptical that play-money market pricing has informational value."

      "text": "I'm not sure, and they don't all have to be the same - the material produced in various replication attempts has not been homogenous and experimenters have been picking our flecks that show any magnetic properties. The largest samples with the most impressive levitation might be ferromagnets, but some of the tests in reproduction attempts ruled out ferromagnetism by flipping their magnets and showing the flecks stood up the same way. So if those ones aren't diamagnetic, they'd have to be paramagnetic. Andrew McCalip's bit of material that responded to a magnet might not even have been LK-99 (and he is open about the possibility that it was made from a contaminant) - it looked like a shiny piece of metal. If you look through the summary table of reproduction attempts on the  spacebattles forum , you'll see that of the institutional reproduction attempts, the results are (in order of appearance in the table, including multiple attempts by the same group): So there's definitely some claimed reproduction of diamagnetism, but nobody calls it strong, even the groups that reproduced partial levitation. At least one paper ( arxiv link ) attempts to rule out ferromagnetism by bringing a magnet close to the sample horizontally and seeing if it attracts, but I don't really believe that unless they use a lower-friction surface (I was initially fooled into thinking we was seeing flux pinning from this group's video due to friction from the rough paper making the sample move in a funny way!). A better ruling out of ferromagnetism is that they flip the magnet for the partial levitation test and the sample stands up in the right way, and that is convincing - I reckon they don't have a ferromagnet. But it could still be paramagnetic (in which case it would have been attracted to the magnet horizontally, but again, unconvincing when it's on a rough paper surface). I've only flipped through these claims quickly, so I could be wrong, but that appears to be the only reproduction attempt that has made it as far as an arxiv paper that claims to have reproduced diamagnetism. It also looks like the only one to reproduce the partial levitation that has gotten as far as being written up for the arxiv. Diamagnetism itself isn't rare (you're a diamagnet, see levitating frog videos), but strong diamagnetism is. So it wouldn't surprise me if some diamagnetism is reproduced (as in some of the above reproduction attempts), I'm just pretty skeptical it's very strong at this point, or the primary explanation for the partial levitation."

But following this process (or similar) it wouldn't actually be trivial to make the footage look this convincing. There's the accurate reaction to the slightly shaking pen at the start, the convincing snapping followed by smooth slow down back into the 'pinned' position which doesn't follow a simple easing curve...

Let's break down each of the components: In the study of superconducting materials, the difference between ZFC and FC magnetization curves can provide insights into the superconducting properties of the sample, especially the behavior of magnetic vortices in type-II superconductors. The statement \"The bifurcation in FC and ZFC magnetization measurement cannot be explained without superconductivity\" implies: When studying a particular material, if the magnetization measurements taken using the FC and ZFC methods diverge (or bifurcate) from each other, and no other phenomena can explain this divergence, then superconductivity might be the underlying reason for the observed behavior. In essence, the bifurcation or divergence between the two measurements becomes evidence for the presence of superconductivity in the material under investigation. Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where certain materials can conduct electric current with zero resistance below a critical temperature. This state also excludes magnetic fields, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. The different behaviors of FC and ZFC measurements in superconductors can be attributed to the way superconductors respond to external magnetic fields and how they trap and handle magnetic flux lines, especially in the case of type-II superconductors. In summary, the bifurcation or divergence between FC and ZFC magnetization measurements in a sample can serve as evidence of superconducting behavior if no other explanations are feasible."

The key reasons I give this low probability are: However, there remains some possibility that the original team's measurements could be validated, especially if they provide access to samples and data. Extraordinary claims sometimes do turn out to be true after rigorous verification.

      "text": "@QuantumObserver  Here goes, starting basic and getting more technical: -The stoichiometry (ratio of elements in a compound) is not the only determinant of the structure and properties of a material. For a classic example, both graphite and diamond are the same element (Carbon) but exhibit different crystal structures. This is because they are \"processed\" differently: the diamond is subjected to extreme pressures which allows it to form a different crystal structure which is metastable at normal pressures (diamond will indeed slowly convert to graphite). -It is possible to have a precise stoichiometry AND a ~stable at room-temp-pressure~ crystal structure in mind for a compound without it being trivial (and in some cases, possible) to synthesize it. There isn't necessarily a synthetic route for some compounds due partly (primarily?) to the tendency of materials to phase separate. Let's say I want to make an alloy of element X and element Y. Well, I can mix them together and heat them up until they melt, but as they cool, they might just separate back out into phases of X and Y, so I'm left with a chunk of material that is made up of alternating microscopic phases of each element, rather than a true alloy of \"XY\". -It is very likely that there are competing phases of Pb(10-x)Cu(x)PO4(6)O that form when the material is synthesized. Let's assume that the superconducting phase is precisely where x=1. That is, there is a 10:1 ratio of Pb:Cu in the phase. Now, when the material cools, you may get that phase. But more likely, you would get some amount of that phase, and another amount of a different phase where x=0, and some of another phase where x=0.2, and some of another phase where x=1.6 and some of another phase where x=2, all mixed together in one chunk of material. There's no way to like, mechanically or chemically separate these. And it'll dilute the effects of superconductivity in the material. -So, the trick is to develop a synthetic chemistry route by which you can form ONLY the phase you want. This may be a fairly open-ended problem (there's a technical term I'm forgetting for a problem that doesn't necessarily have a solution). -One explanation for why the material isn't \"levitating\" as well as people think is because if, say, 50% of the material is superconducting and 50% is just subject to gravity like us normal, non-SC chunks of matter, it may levitate... poorly? -Another problem is that we truly have no idea what the effect of defects are on this material. It's possible that even if the material is phase-pure, small variations in synthesis may induce different levels of defects in the material (vacancies of each element, self-interstitials, symmetry-breaking defects, maybe even some kind of dislocation {probably not?}, etc etc etc). In fact, it is also possible that the superconductivity is OWED to the presence of one of these types of defects in the material at a certain concentration. Perhaps you could achieve this as well through mechanical processing. Say, if someone presses firmly on the sample or drops the sample enough times it could induce some small-enough amount of work-hardening to affect the SC measurements, though I doubt this scenario in particular is plausible. Therefore, different labs may be synthesizing the same material with different intrinsic defect concentrations, resulting in different measurements. Hopefully this conveys the complexity in the synthesis."

Sure, the paper measured other stuff too, and these don't point to superconductivity. But the previous replication attempts did this too, and traders were seemingly happy to ignore - it's all about that hover, it seems. And sure, this might not pan out, so let's see some reproduction of the magnetic susceptibility measurements - seems like a measurement with high uncertainty. And yeah it's not as diamagnetic as you would associate with superconductors, and \"interesting\" doesn't imply superconducting... But - this paper was pretty much the first to confirm something interesting!  If they'd measured the diamagnetism in isolation and the paper's title was \"LK-99 is the second-most diamagnetic material known\", I'm guessing this market would have gone significantly up rather than down.

In a uniform field these cancel out and the material experience no net force but near a dipole magnet the field gets stronger nearer the magnet so its attracted.

The fact that none of those things has happened doesn't leave many possibilities it's real.  i.e. to be real the researchers have to 1) not have samples they are willing to share 2) not care they are being slandered all over the world 3) be basically MIA for a few weeks 4) for some reason, never to have convinced anyone who's willing to stand up for them in public. That situation is definitely possible.  It's just not that likely.  So if I initially started with 50/50 it being real, for me, 45% of the probability mass in YES is immediately followed by one of the strong proofs. The fact there haven't been proofs doesn't disprove the claims, it just makes it hard to satisfy the criteria for them to be true, based on what has happened. Alongside this, the possibilities for it being a mistake, or a fake are basically unchanged.  I  guess they have slightly decreased since in fake cases, the researchers often flee, or have some money-making scheme as their motivation - neither of those has apparently happened, so that space has shrunk too. But still, the space of \"slightly careless, very hopeful, somewhat frustrated, somewhat disogranized\" is still all valid (since that's what all the recent evidence from the team has indicated).  All that is why I'm basically <5% YES now.  NO could still happen, it just requires some very specific and rare circumstances for that story to make sense now."

What if instead we see angular matching and pinning driven by 1D superconduction rejecting magnetic flux from some angles but not others?  This wouldn't match the Wikipedia definition of \"Meissner effect\", but it doesn't sound to me like a failure of the LK paper to replicate.  The video they showed didn't look like a Wikipedia-defined Meissner effect in the first place. Saying you'll go by the opinions of experts doesn't make sense to me here.  The experts can agree on what's actually happening inside the material (eg 1D superconducting lines only allowing magnetic field within that line) and when you earnestly say to them \"But is that  really  the Meissner effect?\" shrug and say \"Depends how you define it...\" or some will say \"Yes\" and some say \"No\" and some will say \"No but that doesn't matter.\"  The criterion for resolving your prediction market isn't something an expert can tell you; they can only resolve the factual question of what's going on inside an LK sample, not the linguistic or prescriptive question of \"what you meant\" or \"should have meant\" by your resolution criterion. (I wish in retrospect that I or you or someone had paused and composed very carefully worded markets before I'd promoted one to the Internet, but I didn't know that things would blow up like this, or that what was originally touted as a very straightforward synthesis process and replication test would turn out to not be that straightforward.)"

When the magnet is facing up, the force of the magnetic repulsion and the force of gravity are in opposite directions, with the force of magnetic repulsion being slightly greater so that the magnetic material appears to levitate.  This illusion ends when you turn the magnet upside down and the force of magnetic repulsion and the force of gravity are in the same direction, in which case the regular material would fall to the ground.

For one - original bilibili Chinese one shows flipping the magnet  https://targum.video/v/2023/8/1/2534a4408ccce9c13a811e94f16d1543/ If you watch the video, their sample has a triangular sample. When using S pole - sample raises on one edge, then it drops and raises on the other edge (softer edge). Then they switch the pole to N - sample again changes the edge on which it raises. But it definitely \"stands up\" for both poles of the magnet. In another replication they showed the same but there they had S and N written on the magnet (I don't have the video on hand). Simply said, one of first things these scientists do is flip the magnet. They know it is important. Not sure if Andrew did that but it should be easy to test.

The other thing about S.Korean society though... aren't as good. i.e. very high percentage of people are highly religious, very high social and interpersonal conformity, and also the site of one of the world's largest cults.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church   To me that suggests a cultural difficulty of openly disagreeing with those around you, even when they are clearly wrong.  High dependence on local social frame rather than going on your own.  In this view, it leads to more labs kind of going wild. Yes, they're disagreeing w/the majority of the world, but they're also reinforcing each other's beliefs. Like a losing team saying \"we can still win\".  Nobody wants to truly defect. Of course this tendency, if real, would also support your position.  The team is sticking together now, doing their secret negotiations or whatever, and nobody is defecting by leaking a sample. The problem with this is that we already know someone defected at least once, by publishing the first paper. That guy probably did want recognition. So if he does want it... why doesn't he also mail a sample to someone to test.  That would achieve his goal. Maybe he doesn't have a sample, maybe they're forgiving him and bring him back in. Those are real possibilities.  But also maybe he just doesn't have a sample that would actually work. Or maybe he does have a sample, and privately tried to have it validated by another korean lab friend, but found it's bunk. So shut up and hasn't openly sent it internationally. Yes thanks for discussing this. You're totally right there are still live scenarios."

Thus, we are led to ask whether the first hallmark - perfect conductivity - is also lost. The answer is a bit equivocal, and the details are the subject of ongoing research. [...] Faced with these fallen hallmarks, one might well ask what really is the essential universal characteristic of the superconducting state. The answer is the existence of the many-particle condensate wavefunction psi(r), which has amplitude and phase and which maintains phase coherence over macroscopic distances.\""

To people questioning the resistance being too high, that is because the researchers are using U = IR to measure. The lowest voltage that the measuring instrument can reliably measure is 10^-9 V.   10^-9 V divided by 10^-4 A = 10 ^ -5 Ohm. Increasing the current could possibly break the sample. Also, in ambient pressure, 0 resistance at or below 110K is an unusual observation. There are only 2 or 3 materials can do this at higher temperature in ambient pressure.  Huazhong University of Science and Technology observed a sample having almost 90 degree levitation and is still working on to get its resistance measured.

Probably, since you think it's fake. The betting odds you'll take are equivalent to some probability of the result being real. Let's say you'd accept odds of win $40 if it's fake, pay $60 if it's real, but no worse. That's equivalent to you thinking there's a 40% chance it's real. When I say \"equivalent\" I mean that the actions you'll take are the same as if they were all contingent on some future roll of a die which you had a 40% chance of losing.

There's a paper going around on Twitter about arrays of carbon nanotubes aligning with an external field, see below tweet with a diagram. So people are suggesting that we are seeing this instead of flux pinning (not all superconductors exhibit flux pinning in any case). I think it's pretty contrived. The authors aren't claiming it's a 1D superconductor, and if the material is a 1D superconductor subject to this alignment force, then it's a funny coincidence that the axis of the 1D superconductor has so far always aligned with whatever direction the fleck of material was longest - i.e. the direction it would stand up in if it were diamagnetic anyway."

If someone told you you could fly using propellers and showed you the math and you developed a jet engine because of it then the initial idea helped you achieve that.

I think the criteria are extremely clear, and as Quantum has said many times in the comments, they're not going to cherry-pick expert opinions.  I highly doubt there'll be a situtation where the expert consensus is \"this is a RTAP-SC\" and also \"no meissner effect or zero resistivity measurement\", but if that WERE the case, then the experts would probably have very good reason to do so.  For instance, a situation where there's something analogous to the meissner effect that can't be strictly defined as one, and resistivity that is 10^-9, rather than 10^-11, but that most experts think should qualify the material as superconducting.  These are WITHIN the spirit of the question, and within the EXACT wording of the question regardless, as Quantum reserves the right to defer to expert consensus. Let the market run and enjoy the fun!

I would interpret him saying NO to it with P > 0.99, but I can also see how someone might also view this as him \"not  strongly  coming out against it\".  But as he said in the article, he runs risks both ways, so it's pretty natural not to comment, and 99.9% of the things he rejects are never published in a real journal and are universally forgotten. Since that's the case, I feel justified in my believe that \"no comment\" from Aaronson is equivalent to P(0.95) NO."

If there was such a thing as a magnetic monopole, a zero-gradient field could exert a force on it, but you need a gradient to exert a force on a dipole. But I think with diamagnetism, it's a bit more complicated. To create an opposing magnetisation in the diamagnetic material in the first place, you want high field. The more field, the more opposing magnetisation you get. But then to exert a force on the resulting magnetic dipoles, you need a field gradient. So I think the force on a diagmagnet is proportional to the product of both the field (which creates magnetisation) and the field gradient (which exerts a force on the resulting dipoles). Ideally you'd have both high field and high gradient to maximise force. With the graphite levitation, the arrangement of magnets is more about stabilisation though than about creating the gradient necessary for there to be a force. In the middle of the quadrupole field there is zero field and thus zero magnetisation of the graphite, so the gradient being maximal there isn't very useful, as there's nothing to exert a force on."

There's some truth to that, in that in pinning, the material is going to want to maintain its orientation, so you don't expect it to rotate. But, since there is a tradeoff between maintaining position and maintaining orientation, I wouldn't want to rule out that a pinned sample might rotate. But there's no smoking gun of pinning here, whether we could rule it our or not. And as I keep harping on about, it's not hard to demonstrate pinning - they could drag the magnet horizontally and see if the fleck follows it - so I don't expect to have to squint and debate when we see it, it should be obvious. So I don't think this is it."

You won't see a fleck react unless the 1D is along the long axis.

In fact the Korean team ended up pursing thin film production probably for this very same reason as thin film technology gives much better control over placement of atoms compared to melting a bunch of stuff and hoping for the best. As some papers mentioned, the \"preferred\" lattice structure is not the more energetically favored one making na\u00efve reproduction like shooting DNA with a shotgun hoping for the right mutations to happen. The original team themselves don't have any large bulk RTSC samples and where moving forward with thin film production instead until inner K-Drama put them on blast.

This is directly speaking to the line between my favored Bayesian/exterior style arguments and others \"you must know the science and do repros\" level.  @haydenjackson this is directly related to your rejection of my using exterior/style data as part of my evaluation.  I feel vindicated by this. I also think if you wish to reject this specific article, it's not so easy. I believe I can find similar articles from hundreds of professional scientists of every political and social belief system. So rejections of this style of analysis have a very hard road since I'm asserting it's common and accepted. If you doubt that please let me know and I can follow up with more info.  Secondly I think another difference that leads to our different views is that to me, if a scientist has not commented on such an important claim, it's basically a no. While to others this is read as being undecided. @joao  My reasons for this view are: scientists hear claims all day and always have to allocate time. Since the original claim was so strong and interesting, failing to respond is an indicator of disbelief; obviously not 100% no, but since belief would have so many consequences (speaking out, changing research programs etc) and we don't see much of that, I have to conclude that the evidence so far is not broadly believed.  So to me of 1000 condensed matter physicists if 990 are silent and 10 publicly research but say no in the end, that's nearly 100% opposition. But others might treat that as >75% undecided.  Perhaps we can use the cold fusion issue as a comparison? What percent of relevant experts spoke out against it? I'd guess that only say 20% went officially on the record as against it, even though actual levels of support are <5% And as far as full belief, I still think it's relevant that no single scientist has spoken out. If lk-99 is real it is easy to prove with a physical sample. Yet nobody is standing up saying that.  There are reasons which could explain this but little evidence for them so far, so it still feels like grasping at straws to try to explain what's happening.

The key points leading to this estimate are: - The material has not yet been independently confirmed to be superconducting at any temperature. Critical features like zero resistance and Meissner effect have not been clearly demonstrated. - The initial announcement was met with widespread skepticism from experts, given the extraordinary claims that would overturn decades of superconductivity research.  - There are some inconsistencies and irregularities around the initial studies, like unauthorized uploading of unfinished papers. This raises doubts about the process. - Early replication attempts have not observed any clear evidence of superconductivity like diamagnetism or zero resistance. However, more rigorous verification is still needed. - Theoretical analyses show the structure may have favorable electronic properties for high temperature superconductivity. But doping may be required to induce superconductivity. - There is a lot of hype and speculation around this material in the media and online communities. But the scientific consensus remains highly skeptical. Overall, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. While LK-99 shows some promise, the current evidence is insufficient to conclude it is likely a room temperature superconductor. More rigorous independent verification is needed. Until then, a conservative estimate of around 20% probability seems appropriate based on the information available so far. But this assessment may change as new results emerge."

[Prof. Kim] \"When the resistence is 0, you observe noise. That's already been observed and it's attached in the graph of the paper. When measuring the data in that graph, we had a significant current of some 30 mA running through LK-99. That there is a \"/\" shape at certain temperatures is a normal state of typical superconductors, as they display metallic characteristics above the critical temperature. But one dimensional materials can't completely overcome the heterogeneity in regards to temperature.\" ... - According to the theoretical research of researchers from abroad, they've said that this appears to be a 'mott insulator', an insulator (that doesn't permit electricity) that appears when the electrons strongly interact with each other. [Prof. Kim] \"It is common knowledge that most mother compounds of superconducting materials are mott insulators. That's certainly possible. I wouldn't disagree with that view. However, that's not the core issue here. Above the critical temperature a superconductor is supposed to be a metal.

It maintains standards of SI units in India and calibrates the national standards of weights and measures. ChatGPT:   If a slim piece of material is standing upright but at an angle on a magnet, and when you turn the magnet upside down the piece stays in its position and angle without falling (with its bottom touching the magnet), the behavior indicates strong magnetic interaction between the material and the magnet. Here are the potential explanations: Of the above explanations, the behavior most closely aligns with the quantum locking observed in type-II superconductors. Still, it's always essential to consider all possibilities and conduct further tests to confirm the material's properties. Let's break down the behavior based on the specific magnetic interactions: In conclusion, based solely on the behavior described, neither diamagnetism nor paramagnetism seem to be sufficient explanations. The behavior is more indicative of flux pinning observed in type-II superconductors (quantum locking). However, always approach such conclusions with caution and consider conducting further tests to confirm the material's properties."

Many known HTSC are thought to have 2D SC and hence should also be prone to the same \"loss\" of Meissner effect when SC planes align parallel to the magnetic field. But they don't, we see Maglev, pinning etc. Why? Because people learned to make bulk samples of such materials and the levitating things we all saw are pieces of ceramics, consisting of millions of randomly oriented crystallites, so all of them can never have SC planes parallel to magnetic field, so there are always some crystallites that maintain the Meissner effect. In contrast, with LK-99 people usually only get tiny single-crystalline particles that can align themselves. Bulk polycrystalline samples of lk-99 are expected to act the same way as all known SC.

He's acting as if in fact he's right, we're wrong, and our doubt is totally unjustified. That's belied by the fact that nearly the entire class of his colleagues do not agree w/him based on their investigation.  When someone denied reality and blames me for not believing even when there are very good reasons not to, it's a sign of manipulation. Think about other famous people who were right but nobody believed. Like Semmelweis. When disbelieved, he patiently collected data and tried to do everything he could do to help his adversaries be able to change their minds.

However, while the Verification Committee has asked Quantum Energy Research Center Inc. for samples, QERC has responded by saying that their currently submitted paper is still under going peer-review, and that they will provide the samples once the paper finishes evaluation. The Verification Committe related to us that \"They said that the review may take 2~4 weeks, but could be delayed further\", adding \"we are repeatedly requesting them for samples\".

Given the difficulty of making anything with a poor recipe I would expect around 10% success of replicating some results, we still seem to be way above that threshold. Also given this uncertainty in the recipe every partial success should have much more weight than every failure since we should be expecting mostly failures if LK-99 is the real deal but really  NO  successful replication and very few partial replications if LK-99 is a dud. Lack of consensus on the properties of the fail attempts are intriguing, if everyone was reporting the same negative behavior I would be much more inclined to think lk-99 being a RTAP SC in some of the samples was impossible.

We're clearly all here because a) it's fun, and b) we're interested in room temperature superconductivity, not whether some other experimental group gets the same kinda sus data as the original paper. So, when I write 'replicate' in the question I am specifically asking: is the room temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity of the compound LK-99 convincingly demonstrated? Specifically, replications should convincingly demonstrate: I don't intend to require that replications be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The arXiv is sufficient for me. However, I do intend to wait a few weeks/months to resolve so that any pre-print can be adequately investigated for data manipulation, fraud, etc. In my utopia, labs that claim to have confirmed/disconfirmed this effect would also publish their raw data with their arXiv submissions, but I'm not holding my breath Since high Tc superconductivity is not my specific field of expertise, I'm willing to defer to a consensus of subject matter experts on whether a pre-print is convincing or not, and I am willing to contact some beyond the usual twitter personalities.

The second paper has many authors, and the authors agree, so the first paper is wrong. \u200b - If the resistance drops discontinuously low in a metal, it is a superconductor, because whether the resistance is zero or not is a matter of noise. I've already written about the presence of noise in experiments in the paper. The question of whether the resistance of a superconducting state is zero or not was debated over 100 years ago. This is a debate that follows every time a superconducting phenomenon is discovered.  I had already written in my first paper that there was a discontinuous \"jump\" and that when I actually measured it, the resistance was zero. So we didn't put it in the second paper.  We didn't write it down because we knew it. \u200b The first way to tell if something is superconducting or not is that there is a \"jump\". There is a discontinuous jump between a state with an energy gap and a state without. In other words, in a metal that is superconducting or not, a jump towards lower resistance is superconducting. Basically Hyeon Tak Kim has gone full rogue and a completely  different definition of what counts for as a superconductor  or not. Not 0 resistivity but some large jump in resisitvity, no matter if it is still MAGNITUDES larger than copper. \u200b Translated with  www.DeepL.com/Translator  (free version) [LINK PREVIEW] \"LK-99 \ucd08\uc804\ub3c4\uccb4 \ub9de\ub2e4\" \uc601\uc0c1 \uc62c\ub9b0 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790 \u2018\uae40\ud604\ud0c1 \ubc15\uc0ac\u2019 \ub9cc\ub098\ubd04 | \uc2e0\ubb38\ubb3c\ud83d\udc40 Ep3"

No, pyrolitic graphite requires a specific arrangement of magnets in order to float in a stable way. Over a single regular dipole magnet like those we're seeing in the videos, it can't hover in a stable way and will fall off to the side until one edge is resting on something to stabilise it (note this is exactly what most videos look like). A stable hover over a dipole magnet is excellent evidence of flux pinning. Showing that you can both push and pull the material with a magnet - that it's pinned - for example by floating it upside down below a magnet, is even better. If the material is too heavy to fully lift itself, then you can still demonstrate the effect in the horizontal plane by putting it it on something floating on water and pushing/pulling it about. It should act like it is locked to a specific position and orientation relative to the magnet. pyrolitic graphite does not do that, diagmagnetic materials don't do that. It's a different phenomenon."

There's also a bit of speculation at play. Given this market may be some others' best bet, as well as the prospect of some YES betters cutting their losses, one might guess that the chances of the price falling decently in the next few months is high. This opens up the possibility of selling out earlier and getting a higher rate of return still than holding until resolution. That makes it look more attractive than just the current size of the mispricing.

You can't just add it to the list of invalid criticisms and declare it so. You cannot dismiss it just because you put it on your list. That is not an argument. She hasn't posted a video and has been evasive about the topic. The glass tube is an unnecessary addition to the photos and detracts from their credibility. She obviously has extensive skills, knowledge, and access to equipment and materials. She's not LARPing. But the lack of a video and evasiveness around it is almost disqualifying. It is possible that she has legitimate but unusual attitudes around providing evidence, and that the floating rock she has made may be real. People can be very odd sometimes and that doesn't mean their work is invalid. Perhaps that's all that's happening. But so far, it's not a good look and I think that explanation is unlikely. And for the record, I fucking love the idea of an anonymous transgressive reproducing groundbreaking research in their kitchen. The dismissal of this sort of thing being possible makes me want it to be true out of spite for those with sticks up their arses or who have the misguided idea that science happens only in pristine laboratories by asexual modal humans.

To verify this exciting claim, we have successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9  this http URL  and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of ~5.22x10^-4  this http URL . In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity of ~1.94x10^4  this http URL  although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition, when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties."

As im having trouble following whats going on at this point honestly\" Subrosian_Smithy's reply: Long long time ago, many smart men and women discover special rock called \"unobtanium\". Unobtanium ALWAYS good for fly like thunderbird AND for unlimited lightning bolts. But unobtanium rocks always melting, which make everyone very sad. Many smart men and women try again, discover less melty special rocks. But rocks still only work in deep-deep-deep-deep-deep winter. Smart men and women discover squeezing some special rocks keeps special rocks from melting. But no-one can squeeze rocks hard enough! Smart men and women discover many different kinds of special flying thunderbird rock. Some thunderbird rocks soar. Other thunderbird rocks float. Smart men and women even discover other special kind of rock, \"hardtofindium\". Hardtofindium good for fly like hummingbird, but NOT like thunderbird. Hardtofindium no good at all for unlimited lightning bolts. Much much later, smart men in Korea say they make new special rock at home. \"Our rock good for fly like thunderbird AND for unlimited lightning bolts\", smart Koreans say. \"That mean rock must be unobtanium.\" \"No,\" say rest of world. \"Your rock only fly like hummingbird. Is hardtofindium.\" \"Yes,\" say smart Koreans. \"Our rock fly like baby thunderbird. Is unobtanium.\" \"No!\" say rest of world. \"Your rock soar around, not float like cloud. Is hardtofindium\" \"Yes!\" say smart Koreans. \"Not all thunderbird rocks float like cloud.\" \"NO!\" say rest of world. \"You not have professional lightning bolt counter to check. Obviously is hardtofindium or fakeobtanium!\" \"YES!\" say smart Koreans. \"We do so have professional lightning bolt counter to check! Checked many times!\" \"Well, let us check too,\" say rest of world. So many smart men and women from all over world go to Korea to look at new special rock. Many smart men and women even try to make new special rock at home, but is hard to check rocks at home. Professional lightning bolt counters rare and expensive. Some smart men and women not study long enough, don't know thunderbird-rock flight patterns, don't know rock-making, don't have good rock-making caves. But everyone excited to see if rock is real unobtanium special rock. Everyone love rock study. Now, smart Russian woman say, \"The guys who wrote the original papers missed something. I think I see a better way to make LK-99.\" So smart Russian woman make special unobtanium at home. Smart Russian woman say, \"My sample levitates just like theirs did.\" \"Levitation means what?\" ask rest of world. \"So is hummingbird or thunderbird? You tell us everything now!\" \"Stop pestering me and my girlfriend,\" say smart Russian woman. New special rock might be hardtofindium or unobtanium. If hardtofindium, is very powerful hardtofindium! No good for power of thunderbolts, but fly like strongest hummingbird ever. If unobtanium, is very strong unobtanium! Won't melt even in springtime, works without squeezing tight. But new special rock definitely very special. More smart men and women should try making and testing special rock. Other smart men and women already making and testing special rock, say \"test not good enough\" or \"rock making steps not good enough\". Later, more smart men and women will definitely finish making and testing. Smart men and women will definitely say what happen. https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/claims-of-room-temperature-and-ambient-pressure-superconductor.1106083/page-14"

      "text": "Well, imagine Nature said anything positive, either an article or editorial. You would surely take that as a positive sign, right? So when they publish something opposite that, you must interpret that negatively. You can't have a setup where them supporting LK-99 is good and them speaking against LK-99 is meaningless.  It must be negative for them to have published a negative article.  I don't think Nature would willingly let a random journalist write something like that w/out serious research and approvals internally.  Within the spectrum of what they could have said, a negative editorial, approved by Nature, is quite bad.  Sure, not as bad as a longer article by someone more famous. But not good. Same argument.  Sure, it's not the  most  negative thing they could have said. But it's not very positive either.  Most researchers have said they're stopping, right?  In the space of \"I'm going to keep going and devote more resources\" to \"I'm stopping\", the latter is  bad  news for LK-99.  You can't have both ends of the spectrum be good for you.  Again, it's not over.  I want people to keep researching. But I do want to try to interpret new information fairly. Poking holes is fine but it would have been better if the alleged LK-99 superconducting temperature were not exactly the same as the one that they were attacked for, as being from an impurity. Of course, it could just be chance. But, if this really is independent, the temp would be a relatively random number.  So accidentally landing on the very temp that your impurity would mess things up at is not a good sign. Will you really apply this fairly? i.e. if the editors of Nature all cheered with the researchers, and were super openly positive about LK-99, do you expect me to believe you wouldn't be promoting that as evidence for YES?  I believe you would (and that would be correct). But once you admit you WOULD accept positive sentiment, it's not reasonable to claim that negative sentiment is meaningless.  Nature can 100% make mistakes...but having Nature as your enemy, particularly in an abstract, scientific claim, is not overall a good thing for a theory.  Again, same issue. If you would accept theoretical evidence for YES, you have to accept the lack of it as evidence for NO. Otherwise you've set up a logical situation where literally everything you see can be recast to support your position. Why even do any research when you believe that?  But anyway, these results not being bad is a good thing for LK-99.   Anyway I'm not asking for much - I hope it's real, and I hope scientists continue experimentation and theorization. Luckily the ingredients and process don't seem especially difficult.  But for rigor in interpretation, we need the equivalent of pre-registration of our hypotheses. Mine would be: If Nature is positive about LK-99, it's good for LK-99 being real, and if they're negative, it's bad. Neither is a headshot, ofc. Within the space of \"I found a room temp superconductor\", getting the result:  LK-99 is not even an average case. This is a bad case.  Good cases look like \"Multiple Nobel prize winners fly to your lab and congratulate you, you are invited to conferences, the president of South Korea personally meets you, Samsung President offers to hire you and fund your lab.\"  None of that has happened. Literally thousands of potentially convinceable people remain unconvinced, just a few miles from their lab. That must count as evidence for NO.  In the space of potential RTSPSCs it does not  have  to be difficult to produce, or inconsistent, or obscure, or unpredictable.  The researchers don't have to be incommunicative.  It may be an accident that this is happening, but it's also consistent with NO interpretations."

It is hard for me to see, but based on what they're saying and the fact that this seems intended as proof that the repulsion is uniform, I think it does not flip. So that looks like uniform repulsion without dead weight forcing the orientation. And yet it rotated - whereas a pinned sample would want to resist that."

      "text": "Response from ChatGTP (GPT-4): First, let's summarize the criteria: Before offering possible explanations, let's examine and exclude others: Given these exclusions, and keeping in mind all the criteria mentioned, there's one possibility that could explain this phenomenon, namely: A Material Exhibiting Room-Temperature Superconductivity with High Stability : Room-temperature superconductivity is an area of active research in physics. A superconductor levitates over a magnet due to the Meissner effect, regardless of the polarity of the magnet (criterion 7), and the levitation can be stable if the superconductor is trapped in a state known as a \"flux pinning\" or \"vortex pinning\". This effect occurs when imperfections in the superconductor cause magnetic vortices that pin the material in place above the magnet, preventing it from wobbling (criterion 5). This could also explain the \"partial\" levitation (criterion 3) as the material would not be completely expelled from the magnetic field, only from areas around the pinning sites. In terms of the material's size (criterion 2), as long as the material is small enough to be lifted by the magnet's field and has sufficient pinning sites, it should be possible for it to levitate. Importantly, this explanation requires that the new material exhibit superconductivity at room temperature and ambient pressure (criterion 8), something that is not currently known to exist as of my training data cut-off in September 2021. It is also important to note that there must be no external systems impacting the material (criterion 9), this system would rely solely on the inherent properties of the new material and the single magnet. Lastly, this explanation does not violate any known law, theorem, or principle of known physics. It would, however, represent a significant advancement in the field of superconductivity, which currently doesn't have any known room-temperature superconductors. But since you specified not to exclude possibilities that are not \"typical\" or have yet to be discovered, it remains a viable hypothetical explanation that fulfills all the criteria."

      "text": "The international standard for superconductivity, according to refs in the original LK99 paper, requires resistivity ~ 10^-11 Ohm*cm. I expect serious labs to be able to do this measurement. In cases where we don't see this limit reached, but other necessary characteristics are observed (Meissner effect, phase change) I will go with expert (or wiki) consensus. I suspect that most experts would agree a situation with R > 0, Meissner observed, phase change observed would be an example of the superconductor-insulator transition. I expect serious labs to be able to take a fleck of LK-99 and change its orientation with respect to applied magnetic fields in order to demonstrate that magnetic field expulsion is greatest when the sample is perpendicular to the applied field. This seems like it should satisfy the Meissner effect criterion. In really weird situations where we are rethinking the traditional rules of superconductivity, I would defer to experts.  I  personally  do not think this should be allowable, but if overwhelming expert consensus is that LK-99 with Au doping instead of Cu means that original LK-99 is a superconductor, it would be perverse to resolve this as NO. If there is no consensus, I am not likely to allow substitutions. If there's no convincing evidence of superconductivity, this market is a NO.  Same as above. 'Hopeful' seems distinct from 'convinced' so, this market would be a NO.  I hope this has helped. I believe everything I wrote here is consistent with the update I am about to make to the market description addressing resolution criteria. TL;DR: I have a strong sense of what replication should look like and have tried to describe this to the greatest possible extent above and in the description. However, I think it would be bad and wrong to resolve this market about the superconductivity of LK-99 contrary to consensus of experts in the field, especially if the uncertainty/ambiguity is in areas where I am less familiar (materials synthesis/structure, for example)."

(The key either existing or not existing is important in this analogy as either you find it or you don't, there's no other room to find it in. Just like LK-99, either it is proven to exist or it doesn't exist or you haven't found it) Now you've searched what you think is 80% of the area but it's also possible you've skipped over it in such a large area that you've searched.
